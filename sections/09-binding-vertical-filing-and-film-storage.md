 {% include pagebreak.html canvas=237 %} The use of typescript and near-print in the production of small editions 
of documents of internal circulation in 
scholarship need not necessarily give rise 
to new library problems. If most of these 
documents turn out to be books of size appropriate for binding, the librarian need 
not be subjected to any change in routine 
corresponding to the change in the methods 
of distributing written matter among scholars. But if it should develop that a considerable proportion of these documents of 
internal circulation are of less than book 
size, the librarian will find that the difficulty he already knows with his pamphlet 
problem increases. This problem is already supplemented by that of provision for 
books on film. How may the different forms 
of written material entrusted to the librarian's care be most conveniently and 
economically preserved? What are the costs 
of keeping this material in suitable condition for continued use? 

Materials to be stored by libraries 
fall into four classes: bound books, 
pamphlets, loose-leaf material, and film 
strips. It is safe to say that any document that is more than half an inch thick 
is likely to be bound and treated as a book. 
Documents of less than that thickness may 
be shelved in pamphlet binders or combined 
in groups to form volumes of ordinary book 
size. An alternative treatment is that 
used for loose-leaf material, that is, to 
store them in vertical filing cases with 
folders and guides to make them easily accessible, or to lay them in manuscript boxes to preserve them as safely as possible. 
Microcopied material in the form of film 
rolls may be kept in small boxes, labeled 
and shelved like books. Three types of 
costs appear here: filing, binding, and 
library shelving. The latter are discussed 
in Chapter II.

## Vertical Filing 

The vertical filing system, rather {% include columnbreak.html canvas=237 col=2 %} than ordinary library shelving, is used for 
the temporary storage of items of pamphlet 
or typescript memorandum size. When a considerable volume of this material accumulates, two alternatives present themselves. 
If the vertical file system is adopted for 
the permanent storage of pamphlets and 
typescript, the library pays at the rate of 
$5.00 or $6.00 per 1000 pages for storage 
equipment. If the accumulation is bound as 
periodicals are bound, when enough articles 
on a subject have been brought together, 
the cost of binding the contents of a file 
drawer in books averaging one inch in thickness would be from $20.00 to $30.00; in 
books averaging four inches in thickness, 
it would be from $10.00 to $20.00, with a 
button binding being used. The choice between these two courses depends as much 
upon the nature of the material itself as 
upon cost considerations. 

## Binding: (a) Vertical File Material 

A simple form of binding used for 
vertical file material up to forty or fifty 
pages in length is *wire stapling*. This is 
done with the small stapling machine, costing about $5.00, that is part of standard 
office equipment. The cost is almost exclusively a labor cost. 5000 staples can 
be purchased for $2.00. A worker can staple about 500 to 600 documents an hour at 
a labor cost of $.40. Wire stapling by a 
commercial service shop costs about $.02 a 
copy. Machine stapling, including a suitable paper cover, is available at a cost 
of a few cents a copy. This will take care 
of items up to ¼″ in thickness. Wire 
stapling through the fold is not suitable 
for ordinary typescript on typescript paper, but it can be used for any printed or 
photo-offset items published in one signature of sixteen or thirty-two pages. 

*Spiral binding* is a form of notebook 
binding that is becoming increasingly popular 
for vertical file material. It first appeared a few years ago in Europe and was {% include pagebreak.html canvas=238 %} introduced in America through an American 
magazine. It is used for pamphlets and 
catalogues in Europe and for small edition 
publications. Loose sheets are held together by rings as in the simplest loose-leaf notebook style, but instead of two or 
three heavy rings, a series of thin wire 
ones is fastened along one side of the 
sheets to be bound together. The advantages are that the book lies perfectly flat, 
is absolutely flexible, the inside margins 
are not obscured in any way, and there is 
no trouble with a double spread of page. 
The price is determined by two factors: 
quantity and length of the side to be spiral bound. An 11″ side, which is the common one used in schools, in quantities of 
1000, with each copy ¼″ in thickness, 
would cost approximately $50.00. The price 
goes down as the quantity increases, 2500 
copies getting a 10% discount; 10,000 having a 20% discount, etc. 

Spiral binding has not been unanimously approved by librarians. They claim 
that it is hard to keep on the shelves and 
needs more storage space. Also, there is 
no place on the back of the book for title, 
author, or reference number; and this makes 
it necessary to take each spiral-bound item 
off the shelf to ascertain if it is the desired copy. The Spiral Binding Company 
suggested the use of labels, to be pasted 
on the shelves immediately below the books 
in question. The question of permanency 
was also raised by the librarians. In answer to this, tests were made between spiral binding and thread-sewn books that 
seemed to prove that sheets could be pulled 
out of thread-sewn books more easily than 
out of spiral-bound books. The number of 
rings tends to make a stronger binding. An 
example of its use may be found in Dr. 
Charles C. Peters' thesis material, which 
has been published in reduced-size offset. 

## Binding: (b) Pamphlet and Periodical Material 

For items of pamphlet thickness, 
four binding techniques are available: 
namely, the spiral binding and the stapling 
mentioned above, pasting, and wire stitching. Pasting, next to 'stapling, is the 
simplest method of fastening sheets of a 
pamphlet together, one fold inside of another. This method, however, is for binding only a few sheets and is for very temporary work. 

 {% include columnbreak.html canvas=238 col=2 %} There are two common methods of 
wire stitching: saddle-and side-wire 
stitching. With saddle-wire stitching, the 
pamphlet is opened in the middle and layed 
face down (or face up). The stitching is 
done on a machine which holds a spool of 
wire from which staples are made and driven 
through the sheets in the fold and clinched 
on the other side. Side-wire stitching is 
the same method, except that the stitching 
is done through the side of the collected 
sheets instead of through the fold. Saddle-wire stitching is used when sheets are folded as one signature; side-wire stitching is 
used when two or more signatures are gathered side by side. Wire stitchers can be 
used for items up to ½″ in thickness. 

Pamphlet producers, like periodical 
publishers, usually pass their binding 
costs on to the library. Library binderies 
have attained a distinct recognition in the 
bookbinding industry in recent years, and 
are now considered as being a separate 
branch of bookbinding. The United States 
Census Bureau, in its 1925 statistical report on the binding industry, put library 
binderies in a class by themselves. The 
American Library Association in 1922 had a 
meeting with the Employing Bookbinders of 
America and the two groups drew up some 
principles to be observed in library book- 
binding. 

The library, in assuming the costs 
of pamphlet and periodical binding, sometimes puts them in separate bindings, but 
usually groups them and binds them into 
volumes for reference. The publishers of 
periodicals generally have the responsibility of determining how many issues of a 
magazine constitute a volume. Monthly 
school magazines, usually issued ten times 
a year, form a volume for each ten numbers; 
magazines issued each month during the year 
generally form a volume every six months. 
Extra thick volumes of magazines and newspapers must receive special care and usually have to have reinforcement in the form 
of a strong lining or back strip. If the
periodical or pamphlet producer uses a sufficiently heavy cover stock, he can save 
the library the extra cost of pamphlet care 
that is involved in fitting pamphlets into 
binders. 

The only justification for transferring the cost of adequate binding to libraries is a situation in which a substantial proportion of an edition is distributed {% include pagebreak.html canvas=239 %} to users who will not require that it be 
well bound. If an entire edition of a 
pamphlet is to go to libraries which will 
catalogue and shelve it, it might as well 
be bound with boards heavy enough to sustain library use. If, on the other hand, 
the edition is to go principally to users, 
whether libraries or individuals, who will 
put it in a vertical file, the heavy cover 
boards are not only an unnecessary cost, 
but an actual disadvantage. 

## Binding (c) Bookbinding Techniques[^n1]

[^n1]: For excellent articles on binding, the reader is referred to *The American Printer*, December, 1932, pp. 36--38; also January, 1933 and July, 1933, p. 17. 

In the case of books of full standard thickness, saddle stitching, side 
stitching, and sewing are most commonly 
used. With side stitching, the pages do 
not lie flat when opened, but must be held 
open; sewed and saddle-stitched books lie 
flat and show the full inside margin. 

Side stitching is done by making 
small holes in the sheets near the back and 
passing the thread through these holes. If 
the stitching is done by machine, punches 
are used to make the holes. 

Saddle stitching is done through 
the folds of the signatures. The stitches 
are made long to prevent weakening of the 
book by too much perforation. Usually a 
strip of muslin or crash is glued on the 
back for reinforcement. 

In sewed books (and the great majority of books are sewed) each signature 
is sewed to its neighbor, so that an unlimited number of signatures may be contained in a book. These signatures are 
piled together and cords or tape are fastened crosswise across the back in grooves 
made for the purpose and fastened in the 
grooves by kettle stitching. The usual 
number of cords used is five. The finished 
product is a flexible and strong piece of 
work. When the signatures have been gathered and sewed, the edges are trimmed and 
the back rounded and reinforced with muslin 
or crash. It is during this reinforcing 
process that the headbands are added. Then 
the filler is ready for its cover and the 
finishing steps. 

Paper is an important factor in 
binding and should be flexible in proportion to its size. When the grain of the 
paper runs the same way as the binding edge, {% include columnbreak.html canvas=239 col=2 %} the book will lie flat when opened; if the 
grain runs crosswise of the binding edge, 
the book will not lie flat when opened, but 
will be stronger. In handmade paper, the 
fibers run in all directions, so the paper 
is equally strong in any position. 

## Binding (d) Bookbinding Costs 

There are many factors aside from 
the technique of binding that determine the 
cost of bookbinding, which is fundamentally 
a running cost in book production, as it 
increases with the size of the edition. The 
most important factors are: (a) *size factors*: number of pages, signatures, and 
copies, and the size of the book; (b) *materials factors*: weight of paper, number 
of cords or tapes used in sewing, kind of 
cover material (leather, imitation leather, 
buckram, cloth, or paper); (c) *style factors*: headbands, treatment of corners 
(round or square), treatment of fly leaves 
(tipped or turned), stamping or lettering, 
and treatment of illustrative material (signatures or single pages, placed at end of 
book of interleaved with text).

Though it is obviously insufficient 
to speak of an "average" library book, 
nevertheless, a sample quotation on the 
cost of bookbinding in a style suitable for 
library shelving will illustrate the general cost level. The costs, as shown in 
Table XXXVI on the following page, are based 
on a good library binding of cloth vellum, 
linen finish. 

The cost of binding newspapers or 
large quantities of typescript (such as the 
NRA hearings) enters into the cost analysis 
that will help determine whether such materials should be preserved by binding and 
shelving or in microcopy form. It is significant that the costs of binding a year's 
issue of a newspaper like the New York *Times* 
(approximately 20,000 pages, twenty-four 
volumes) amounts to $54.00, and storage 
costs would be from $48.00 to $72.00, while 
the cost of storage space required for the 
film copy of the same material would be 
about $1.50. 

## Film Storage 

There are three ways of storing 
microcopied material on 16 mm. or 35 mm. {% include pagebreak.html canvas=240 %}

film strips. They can be mounted flat, 
stored in rolls, or on spools. Flat mounting on cards (suggested by Mr. Atherton 
Seidell) is adapted only to very short 
strips, no wider than a card used in a vertical file system---hence 5″ to 11″ is a 
maximum length of strip. Roll storage is 
adapted to the lengths such as those produced in the Leica or EKA camera---5′ to 15′. 
The separate lengths of film are placed in 
receptacles which may be either small tin 
pill boxes or larger partitioned metal or 
paper boxes holding twenty-five rolls of 
film. The longer rolls of film require 
spool storage. The Recordak Corporation 
furnishes spools with its film. Each spool{%- include columnbreak.html canvas=240 col=2 %} will hold 200 feet of film; it fits in a 
cardboard box 4″ x 4″ x 1″.

It is not known with certainty how 
much special care of atmospheric conditions is necessary in the preservation of 
the ordinary cellulose acetate "safety" 
film used in copying documents. The research under way at the Bureau of Standards will result in information upon this 
important cost factor in film storage. The 
storage of nitrate films is very expensive 
because of fire hazards; the storage of 
cellulose acetate films is not complicated 
by any fire hazard.
