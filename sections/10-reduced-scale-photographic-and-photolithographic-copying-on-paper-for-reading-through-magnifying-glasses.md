{% include pagebreak.html canvas=243 %} The predominance of area costs in 
the techniques employing the principle of 
photography furnishes a constant temptation 
to reproduce as large a number of words as 
possible on a given area. The ease with 
which an original copy can be reduced in 
size in the course of photographic reproduction increases the temptation, and the 
mathematical law that utilization of area 
increases by squares while reduction of 
linear dimension of the writing proceeds 
arithmetically clinches the economy argument in favor of reducing all texts to the 
smallest legible size. 

## Thresholds of Legibility 

There are, however, three thresholds of legibility. The first and most 
important is the minimum that can be read 
easily with the naked eye. This minimum 
was placed, in an earlier chapter of the 
book, at seven-point (newsprint) type, or 
pica typescript reduced to 80% of full size. 
Below this minimum there is a range down 
to five-point type, or pica typescript reduced to 70%, within which writing is decipherable with the naked eye, though not 
easily legible. Within this range a reading glass will facilitate the reading. When 
still further reduced, writing is indecipherable with the naked eye, but legible 
with the reading glass or magnifying glass. 
However, as the size of the letters is diminished, a lens system with higher magnifying power than the ordinary reading glass 
is required, and the higher magnifying power brings with it a diminution in the field 
of vision. This hampers speed of reading 
and sets a limit to reductions that are to 
be read by direct magnification. Another 
limiting factor is the requirement that 
sufficient light must be reflected from the 
small area of paper that constitutes the 
field of the lens system. Ordinary light 
intensities that would suffice for comfortable reading with the naked eye do not ade{%- include columnbreak.html canvas=243 col=2 -%}quately illuminate the greatly reduced area 
that is to be read with a magnifying glass. 

If seven-point newsprint type is 
taken as the smallest type that can be read 
easily with the naked eye, then a 50% reduction of this type, can be read conveniently with the reading glass but not with 
the naked eye.[^n1] Below this level, it is 
possible that more elaborate reading glass 
systems may permit the reading of texts 
that have been copied with higher reduction 
ratios, perhaps as much as eight or ten diameters from pica typescript. 

Beyond the limit set to reduction 
by these optical devices lies the zone in 
which a projector will yield a legible 
image. Applications of the projection system will be discussed in the next chapter. 

The different zones in which these 
three methods---naked eye reading, reading 
glass reading, and projection reading---are 
operative can be charted as shown in Table 
XXXVII on the following page. 

## Reduced Size Newspapers 

There have been several practical 
efforts to utilize these reductions in the 
reading glass zone. The Joint Committee 
coöperated with the New York *Times* in an 
inquiry addressed to librarians as to 
whether they would prefer, for permanent 
preservation, the full-size rag paper copy 
of the *Times* or a rag paper copy reduced 
one diameter by the photo-offset process. 
A majority of the subscribers to the rag 
paper edition expressed a preference for 
the small size copy because the advantages 
in storing and handling were deemed sufficient to compensate for the disadvantage 
in reading. A copy of a page of the *Times* 
reduced to this scale is shown. But the 
response was not sufficient to warrant the 
company in shifting from the present rag 
paper edition to the reduced size edition. 
It appeared that, because of the additional 
expense, the company could find it possible {% include pagebreak.html canvas=244 %}

THRESHOLDS OF LEGIBILITY IN REDUCTIONS OF TYPESCRIPT AND NEWSPRINT 

| Typescript | Newsprint | Naked Eye | Reading Glass | Projection |
|----|----|----|---|----|
| Pica typescript full size. Pica typescript reduced to 80% of full size | Newsprint Full size | Easy | | |
| Pica typescript reduced to 70% of full size | Newsprint reduced 50% | Difficult | Easy | | 
| Pica typescript reduced seven diameters, to 10%-14% of full size | Newsprint reduced 55%-65% of full size | Impossible | Difficult | Easy | 
| Pica typescript reduced twenty-two diameters, to 44% of full size | Newsprint reduced sixteen diameters, to 6% of full size | Impossible | Impossible | Easy | 
| Pica typescript reduced to 4% of full size | Newsprint reduced twenty diameters, to 5% of full size | Impossible | Impossible | Difficult |

to make this shift only if a number of subscribers substantially greater than those 
now taking the rag paper edition would desire the reduced size edition. 

Another plan for publishing newspapers in reduced size has been the subject 
of an experiment by the Millar Publishing 
Company, and has been tied in with the development of an interesting reading device 
manufactured by the Bausch and Lomb Company. This direct reading device consists 
of a lens, set in a frame, with a curved 
segment of a cylinder of optical glass 
mounted about two inches above it, and the 
whole system set on a swinging arm, made {% include columnbreak.html canvas=244 col=2 %} adjustable by means of a screw, to 
over the page at the proper distance for 
magnifying purposes. The magnification in 
this system amounts to about three diameters. 
The newsprint is reduced to approximately 
33% of normal size. Experiments in the office of the Joint Committee indicate that 
this device is convenient and practical. 

## Miniature Abstracts and Theses 

Another plan for utilizing these 
low reductions has been put into effect by 
Professor Charles C. Peters of the Pennsylvania State College in reproducing abstracts of theses of the Department of {% include pagebreak.html canvas=245 %}

{% include pagebreak.html canvas=257 %} Education. A sample page of his work is 
shown. On one side of a page, an abstract 
of the thesis appears in pica typescript 
reduced to about 60% of full size; on the 
other side of the page a longer abstract of 
the thesis is reproduced in a reduction of 
90%-95% of normal size. The cost of publishing theses in this format has proven to 
be very low. Three volumes of abstract 
theses, filling 854 typescript pages, and 
containing 300,000 words were published at 
a cost of $300.00. The cost of reproducing 
in reduced size 600 copies of an eighty-page set of abstracts was $107.00 in 1933. 
Two hundred and fifty copies were bound by 
the Spiral Binding Company for $.05 per 
copy, making a total cost of $120.00. In 
1934, the cost of 700 copies was $127.00. 

For reading the miniature print, 
Dr. Peters found after experimentation 
that a stereoscope, with the lenses reversed and with an adapted slide, was most 
convenient for prolonged reading. Dr. Peters 
sells this adapted stereoscope for approximately $3.00. He also recommends an electric illuminated reading glass device, magnifying from two to four diameters and 
selling for about $7.50. A third reading 
apparatus which he suggests is the Clerevu 
Table Magnifier, with a 6" lens on an adjustable stand. This device, magnifying 
two to four diameters, sells for $12.00. 

Besides the abstracts, some of the 
doctoral dissertations of the department 
have been published in substantially the 
Same manner. But in the case of doctoral 
dissertations, a nine- or ten-page abstract 
at the 40% reduction is given first, and 
then the whole dissertation follows in 
miniatured pages at the 90% reduction. These 
dissertations include about 100 pages of 
typewritten material each and average about 
65,000 words per thesis. The cost of dissertations published in this manner is 
$50.00 for 500 copies, including assembling 
and binding, but not including cost of preparing the manuscript. 

## Fiske Method
 
Reference has already been made to 
the publication of the *Covarrubias Tesoro 
de la Lengua Castellana o Espanola* in reduced size for reading with a magnifying 
lens. This publication was related to the 
development sponsored by Admiral Bradley A. 
Fiske, who has developed a hand reading {% include columnbreak.html canvas=257 col=2 %} lens equipment that develops higher magnifications than those available with an ordinary reading glass. In its most recent 
form, the Fiskoscope is a small binocular 
lens equipment set in a frame which can be 
held to the eye like a lorgnette. The 
frame holds a long strip of paper which can 
be moved up or down by rotating a ratchet. 
The text is typewritten with short lines 
so that about 150 words of typescript are 
laid on a page, double spaced. This page 
is then reduced seven diameters. The field 
of vision of the Fiskoscope covers this 
small page; there is, therefore, no difficulty about skimming. But the difficulties 
of skimming might be expected to appear if 
book pages containing 450 words should be 
copied; and a number of persons who have 
tried reading with the device complain that 
it fatigues their eyes. This may be the 
result of habit, for microscope workers 
train themselves to use without fatigue 
lenses of higher magnifying power. A reproduction of a strip of Fiskoscope reading 
matter (Figure LVII) and a picture of a 
Fiskoscope (Figure LVI) are printed herewith. 

The price of reproductions suited 
to this apparatus is certainly attractive. 
In the *American Printer* of January, 1932, 
there is an article stating that Fiske 
books of 100,000 words can be printed on 
two strips of paper at a cost of $.05. Each 
strip of paper is 2 5/8" wide and 23 1/2" 
long, including margins. The typescript is 
reduced to 1/25 of original size, and is 
printed on both sides of the strip of paper. Admiral Fiske secured a quotation of 
$557.00 for an edition of 10,000 books of 
100,000 words, printed on a good quality 
paper. 

## Filmstat Reproduction 

The *New York Times*, Peters, and 
Fiskoscope enterprises have all involved a 
use of the reduced copy methods as an alternative to publication. A different 
class of use is suggested by the experiments of Mr. Atherton Seidell of the U. S. 
Public Health Service, by Dr. L. Bendikson 
of the Huntington Library at San Marino, 
and by the developments under way in the 
Folmer Graflex Corporation of Rochester, 
New York. 

Mr. Atherton Seidell, who has been 
active in promoting what he calls "filmstat" {% include pagebreak.html canvas=258 %} reproduction, counts on reducing book pages 
about ten diameters and reading them by 
several methods. A special magnifier, to 
be manufactured by the Spencer Lens Company, 
will be sold for $5.00 including the handle 
and an eye shade for the eye not used. A 
picture of it is shown. The stand that can 

FIGURE LVIII 

Spencer Magnifier 

be used with the device will sell for about 
$3.00. This system will give about eight 
diameters of magnification. An alternative 
projector device, to cost about $50.00, 
suitable for reading filmstats, will be described in a later chapter on projection 
apparatus. 

## Bendikson Procedure 

Dr. Bendikson uses a Leica camera 
to take photographs of pages on the ordinary moving picture film, with exposures 
about 1" x 1 1/4". Then he lays down a few 
rows of these film copies side by side in a 
printing frame and makes from them a positive copy on paper, exactly as if he were 
making a print from any negative. A reproduction of one of Dr. Bendikson's prints is 
included herewith. 

For reading these prints, he uses a 
low-power binocular microscope. This micro{%- include columnbreak.html canvas=258 col=2 -%}scope is manufactured by E. Leitz, Inc. 
(code word, BSM-B). The image produced by 
this apparatus is a true one, not inverted 
or reversed. Dr. Bendikson uses three different pairs of oculars with this microscope: a-5, with an enlargement power of 
3.5, a-10, with magnification of 73 and 
a-15, which can enlarge 10.5. The a-10 
oculars, which Dr. Bendikson generally uses, 
with a magnifying power of seven diameters, 
will bring back to normal size a page of an 
ordinary octavo book that has been reduced 
to the width of the moving picture film. 

The writer has no experience with 
the optical system used by Dr. Bendikson, 
and cannot estimate how it compares from 
the standpoint of eyestrain with the Fiskoscope. It must be noted that any and all 
pages reproduced by this method are reduced to the same width, namely, one inch, the 
width of the available surface of the moving picture strip. 

## Van Iterson Device 

Professor G. van Iterson, of the 
Technical Univiersity at Delft, Holland, has 
invented a reading device for microprints. 
A picture of it is shown herewith (Figure LXI). {% include pagebreak.html canvas=259 %}

{% include pagebreak.html canvas=262 %}

{% include pagebreak.html canvas=263 %}

The apparatus was designed primarily for 
use with 5" x 7" micro-prints, each print 
containing eighteen pages of letterpress 
material. Dr. Bendikson, who went into the 
question of film copying with Professor 
van Iterson when the latter was in California several years ago, has very kindly 
given the writer an explanatory description of the device. Attached to a desklike 
structure is a bracket, which holds a ring 
illuminator with five small lamps that surround a plano-convex lens. On top of this 
drum-shaped illuminator is a second magnifier. The micro-print is slipped in a 
pressure frame, which slides under the illuminator-magnifier.

## Folmer Graflex Recording Camera 

The Folmer Graflex Corporation has 
developed a recording camera that is used 
to take photographs of meter readings on a 
strip of paper. It is now adapting this 
camera to the general work of record copying. The width of the photographic strip 
in this camera is 2 1/4", That is to say, 
it would reduce an 8" sheet of typescript 
a little less than four diameters, and 
copy a column of newsprint full size. Obviously, the miniature copies made with 
this camera will fall in that zone where 
naked eye reading is beginning to be difficult and reading glass reading is still 
easy. If the camera is developed, as it 
will probably be, to take a long roll of 
paper, the cost of photographic materials 
per page copied will be somewhere in the 
neighborhood of one-third to one-half cent 
a page. This Graflex copying camera, taking pictures directly on paper, will prob{%- include columnbreak.html canvas=263 col=2 -%}ably offer the individual scholar one of 
the most convenient devices for note taking. Since paper costs less than film, the 
scholar can have a much larger copy of his 
pages for a slightly larger material cost, 
and this increase in size may be just sufficient to render the copy legible with 
the naked eye, or with an ordinary cheap 
reading glass. It is to be hoped that 
equipment of this kind may become available 
to American scholars at a price not greatly in excess of the price of typewriting 
equipment. 

Another principle that could be 
used in copying for reading through magnifying glass systems is the principle of 
the multiple exposure machine. If the 
Folmer Graflex multiple exposure camera 
were adapted for document copying, it would 
permit the division of a 5" x 7" sheet of 
paper of film into any number of subdivisions, giving the user the chance to find 
that degree of reduction that best suits 
him from the standpoint of economy of materials on the one hand and prevention of 
eyestrain on the other. 

If a new positive photocopying pa- 
per appears, as was suggested in the preceding chapters, it would be useful in the 
preparation of these reduced-size copies 
on paper. Reduced-size copying on photostat paper is always a possible alternative to reduced-size copying on film, To 
the extent that the use of a film copy negative introduces labor-saving features in 
the making of paper copies, the effect is 
to bring the costs of paper copies nearer 
to the bare cost of materials, and hence 
to emphasize and increase the economies 
that will result for high reduction ratios 
on paper. For the more the factor of material costs predominates, the greater is 
the cost advantage in carrying reductions 
to the furthest practical extreme. 

## Tru-Vue Apparatus 

Reduced scale photography can 
handle pictures as well as texts. The fact 
that a picture must be seen as a whole 
makes it necessary that the field of view 
of any optical system used for viewing reduced-size pictures should be large, and 
this is the sticking point in the development of viewing apparatus that enlarges 
more than two or three diameters. 

{% include pagebreak.html canvas=264 %} A special apparatus, related to the 
old-style stereopticon, has been placed on 
the market under the trade name Tru-Vue.[^n2]
It is a small binocular viewing apparatus, 
which receives a 35 mm. roll of film. The 
Tru-Vue shows "pictures with depth." The {% include columnbreak.html canvas=264 %} pictures viewed are printed double on the 
film, thus yielding the regular stereoptican illusion of depth. The Tru-Vue pictures are, perhaps, suitable substitutes 
for picture post cards. The magnifier sells 
for $1.00.
