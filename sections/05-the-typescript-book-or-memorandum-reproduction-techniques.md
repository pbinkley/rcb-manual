## I. Carbon Paper Copying 

 {% include pagebreak.html canvas=95 %} Carbon paper offers one of the oldest and cheapest means of multiplying typescript in a very few copies. It is constantly used for thesis work. With ordinary skill and an ordinary typewriter, two 
carbons can be made with high legibility 
and at a maximum price of $.05 per page per 
extra carbon. The number of legible copies 
can be increased by increasing the force of 
the typewriter stroke or diminishing the 
thickness of the paper. The Electromatic 
typewriter, which uses electric power in 
making the impression, exhibits great efficiencies here. The following table indicates the number of carbons that can be 
made with one typing and the corresponding 
weights of carbon paper and copy paper. 

TABLE XII 

NUMBER OF CARBONS POSSIBLE WITH ONE TYPING 

| No. of Copies | Weight of Paper | Weight of Carbon Paper |
|-----|-----|-----|
| 1-5 | Over 9 lb.to 6 lb. | 7-8 lb. (standard) |
| 5-10 | 9 lb. onionskin | 5-5½ 1b. (medium) |
| 10-20 (Electromatic) | 9 lb. onionskin | 4 1b. (light) |

The thin paper will increase the 
number of legible copies, but it is useful 
only for multiplying ephemeral material; it 
will not make a book paper. The limit to 
the number of carbon copies that can be 
made into typescript books is set by the 
paper. A paper thin enough to receive with 
fair legibility the seventh copy from an 
ordinary typewriter, or the twenty-fifth 
from an Electromatic, would be too thin for 
book use. 

Of the two elements of first cost, 
the composition costs are the labor costs 
of the fair copy typing; the area costs, 
which vary with the number of pages and 
hence with the number of words put on a sin{%- include columnbreak.html canvas=95 col=2 -%}gle page, are those of the paper on which 
the fair copy is made; the running costs 
are those incurred in producing additional 
carbons. 

For purposes of convenience in estimating composition costs for ordinary 
typing of manuscripts, a normal cost has 
been estimated on the basis of labor at 
$.40 per hour, paper for the fair copy typing at $1.25 per 1000 sheets, onionskin at 
$2.50 per 1000 sheets, and carbon paper at 
$2.50 per 100 sheets. Quotations received 
by the Joint Committee show that prices 
and costs are highly variable, as indicated by Table XIII on the following page. 

A normal cost may be taken as $.40 
per 1000 words and an additional charge of 
$.02½ per page per extra carbon, with the usual 20% discount given on materials 
for manuscripts of over 10,000 words and 
no charge for the materials required to 
produce the fair copy and the first carbon. 
In both cases the format chosen is the 
usual 300-word page of double-spaced pica 
typescript. 

Before the technological limit of 
carbon paper copying is reached, the border 
is crossed to the field of the hectograph. 

## II. The Hectograph Process 

In this report the term hectographing is used to designate any process by 
which approximately 100 to 150 copies of a 
document may be reproduced in methyl-violet {% include pagebreak.html canvas=96 %}

written or typed in methyl violet dye 

 {% include columnbreak.html canvas=101 col=1 %} dye from a single master sheet. 

### a) Gelatin Hectograph Process 

When a sheet of paper (which we 
will call a master sheet) bearing a text 
written or typed in methyl violet dye is
pressed down upon a gelatin surface, the 
methyl-violet image transfers itself to 
the gelatin. If fresh sheets of paper are 
then successively pressed against the gelatin, the methyl-violet image transfers itself to them. Thus a number of copies of 
the original are produced. 

Equipment for the gelatin process 
ranges from the little gelatin pan, on 
which the menu of the thirty-five cent 
lunch restaurant is made, to a power-run 
machine with a rotary drum resembling the 
mimeograph. The Ditto, the Speedograph, 
the Vivid Duplicator, and the Standard Rotary Duplicator are among the best-known 
gelatin process machines. They vary in 
price from $15.00 for a flat-bed machine to 
$475.00 for a power-operated rotary one. 
The gelatin for the rotary models is furnished in the form of films 9″ x 15″ in size, 
which are fastened to the drum of the machine as stencils are fastened on the mimeo{%- include columnbreak.html canvas=101 col=2 -%}graph cylinder; the larger, flat-bed equipment employs a roll with a cloth or fiber 
backing, 9″ to 18″ wide and about 15′ long. 

### b) Liquid Hectograph Process 

A second type of hectograph equipment dispenses with the gelatin. A piece 
of hectograph carbon paper is placed behind the master sheet, with the carbon side 
toward the master paper while the text is 
being written or typed. A reversed carbon 
image is thus produced on the back of the 
master sheet. The master sheet is fastened 
to the cylinder of the machine and the copy 
is reproduced by bringing the side bearing 
the carbon image in contact with fresh 
sheets of paper, which are moistened with a
special duplicating fluid as they are fed 
into the machine. 

There are three kinds of liquid 
process equipment: the Ormig (Figure XX), 
made in Germany and sold for $160.00 to 
$475.00; the Standard New Process Duplicator (Figure XXI), which sells for $187.50 
to $440.00; and the Ditto Liquid Duplicator, fixed at $200.00 for the hand-run 
model and $265.00 for the power-run machine. 

 {% include pagebreak.html canvas=102 %} The Joint Committee has experimented with both the liquid process and the 
gelatin machines. The result of extensive 
comparison in the practical working of the 
two processes is definitely in favor of the 
liquid process as against the gelatin for 
the following reasons: 

1) *Quality of Product*: In the gelatin method, copies in the same run are 
never uniform in shade and are always lighter than the corresponding copies done by 
the liquid process. The age, condition, 
and preparation of the gelatin have a much 
more important effect on the quality of the 
copies done by the gelatin method than do 
the same factors of the carbon in the liquid process. 

2) *Permanence*: Copies produced by 
the liquid process are more permanent than 
those produced by the gelatin method, because the liquid practically dyes the ink 
into the fibers of the paper, while the 
gelatin merely deposits the dye on the surface of the paper. 

3) *Speed*: The rotary liquid machine 
is capable of producing many more copies 
per minute than the flat-bed or rotary gelatin equipment. The time for preparing for 
the gelatin run is almost equal to the actual running time of the liquid machine. 

4) *Simplicity of Operation*: With the 
liquid method, only three operations are 
necessary---typing the original, clipping it 
in place, and turning the handle, or pressing the foot pedal, to produce the copies. 
The gelatin machine requires much more 
preparation. 

5) *Reprint Economies*: Reprints from 
the original master sheet are feasible with 
the liquid process (but not recommended for 
a very long run); they are impossible with 
the gelatin method. 

6) *Gelatin Supply*: It is necessary 
to have on hand as many fresh gelatin films 
as there are master sheets to be run in 
close succession, for a used film must be 
allowed to stand from six to twenty-four 
hours before the dye is sufficiently absorbed and dissipated to allow a new master 
image to be imposed upon it. If a 100-page {% include columnbreak.html canvas=102 col=2 %} document were to be hectographed by the gelatin process in a single day, a supply of 
at least fifty films would be necessary. 

The variable elements in the gelatin process are so much greater than the 
variables in the liquid process that exact 
cost comparisons are unreliable. There are 
no decisive reasons for expecting the gelatin process to operate at a substantially 
lower cost than the liquid method. 

The prices of special supplies for 
the gelatin process are listed below. Where 
the gelatin process equipment is already 
available, it can be used; but the calculation of the place of hectographing in the 
reproduction of typescript is based on the 
use of the liquid process. 

| Hectograph typewriter ribbon | $ .75 to $1.00 each | 
| Gelatin rolls (15′) | 4.00 to 6.00 each | 
| Gelatin films (9″ x 15″) | $.50 to 1.00 each |

## Cost Analysis of Hectographing: (a) Composition and Running Costs 

Composition and running costs for 
hectographing require little analysis. Fair 
and format typings are merged, and composition costs for typing may be figured at 
the normal typing rates. Labor, copy paper, and liquid charges comprise the running costs. Liquid for the hectograph 
process is sold for $2.50 to $3.50 per 
gallon. A gallon will serve to moisten at 
least 6,000 sheets of copy paper or as 
many as 10,000 sheets; it makes no difference whether these are run as 25 copies each 
of 240 separate pages of text, or 150 copies each of 40 different masters. The 
highly calendered copy paper required for 
the best results may be purchased for $1.65 
in quantities of 1000 sheets, with reductions in.price starting at 10,000 sheets. 
For less attractive but perfectly legible 
work, ordinary bond paper at a slightly 
lower price per 1000 sheets is satisfactory, but as it absorbs more fluid than the 
regular copy paper it is really not economical. 

### (b) Area Costs and Legibility 

Area costs are those of the master 
sheets ($1.50 to $3.00 per 1000 sheets) 
and the hectograph carbon paper ($.04 to 
$.06 per sheet in quantities of 100). These {% include pagebreak.html canvas=103 %}

with No.35=M Ormig carbon costing $4.00 per 100 sheets, with 
a reduction in price for larger quantities. This is she 129 
copy from the master sheet. | 

Ormig duplicators range in price from $165.00 to 
$285.00 for the hand operated machines, and $395.00 to 
$495.00 for the electrically operated machines. The V-8 
models take maximum size sheets 9″ X 14″ and the larger 
models V-6 takes shgets up to 14″ kK 17″, 

The Ormigtin (liquid) needed for producing the copies 
cost $2.50 a gallon; a gallon is sufficient to moisten 
15,000 sheets of copy paper. 

There are three grades of carbon to suit different 
lenghts and sharpness of run. No.5 carbon from 1 to 75 
copies. No.d-M up to 200 copies, and No.H=2 for 200 copies 


and over. These carbons are all priced the same. 

 {% include pagebreak.html canvas=110 %} 

 {% include pagebreak.html canvas=111 %} costs are the ones most subject to variation and they are the most important on account of their relationship to legibility. 
If a saving in area costs is attempted by 
using single rather than double-spaced typescript to get more words on the master 
sheet, the legibility of the product diminishes accordingly, but a more important 
consideration is the efficient use of the 
hectograph carbon paper. For the most legible results carbon paper should be used 
only once. Of course if the typewriter is 
set for double-spacing, the carbon may be 
used the second time with no decrease in 
legibility by typing between the lines of 
the first copy. Carbon paper may be used 
as many as three times, but with greatly 
decreasing contrast and sharpness of definition in the letters produced. The following summary of the cost of the dye in 
relation to legibility may be made: 

| a) | High contrast (first use) | $.04 to $.06 per page; average $.045 |
| b) | Medium contrast (second use) | $.02 to $.03 per page; average $.0225 |
| c) | Low contrast (third use) | $.01 to $.01½ per page; average $.015 |

Length of run is also a factor in 
determining the legibility of hectographed 
matter: the first few gelatin copies are 
brighter than the later ones, the diminishing contrast being due to the gradual exhaustion of the supply of dye; with the 
liquid process the decrease in legibility 
begins after the 100 or 150 mark is reached. 
This diminution in contrast may be regulated somewhat, however, as the operation 
of the liquid process machines may be modi{%- include columnbreak.html canvas=111 col=2 -%}fied to yield a few more brilliant copies 
or a greater number of paler ones, and as 
the carbon papers are sold in various 
grades---i.e., hard, medium, and soft---adapted for runs of varying length. 

The efficiency range of the hectograph begins with the five or six copies 
where it crosses the carbon paper technique 
and runs up toward 200. Bound in place 
here are four samples of hectograph work. 
They are numbered to indicate their place 
in the run. Figure XXII is made with the 
gelatin process; note that the letters are 
smoother and more blurred than those made 
by the liquid process. Figures XXIIIa and 
XXIIIb are made with the Standard New Process Duplicator, one page being taken from 
an early place in a run, the other being 
selected from a later part of the run. A 
comparison of these two pages will show the 
difference in legibility of work taken from 
two different places in runs. Figure XXIV 
is made with the Ormig liquid duplicator. 
By comparing these four sample pages, the 
reader will be able to note the variations 
between the products of the gelatin and 
liquid hectograph processes, and to estimate the curve of diminishing legibility as 
the number of copies taken from the master 
sheet increases. 

The table below shows the cost of 
hectographing by the liquid process a book 
of) 100,000 words, "with typing figured at 
$.50 per hour, labor for running the duplicating machine figured at $.40 an hour, a 
fresh sheet of carbon used for each master 
sheet, and hectograph copy paper used for 
the run. The best possible hectographed 
product will result.

### c) Application of Hectographing to the Problems of Scholarship 

When compared with the average quotation for typing, these figures indicate 
that the hectograph will distribute the 
documents of internal circulation among 
scholars at prices so nearly within the 
range of those that authors are accustomed 
to assume in connection with the preparation of their typescript manuscripts, that 
the cost of giving a limited distribution 
in hectographed form could be assumed by 
the writers themselves with little more 
trouble than they now take in distributing 
reprints of their articles from periodicals. 

An experiment in the use of this 
method as a means of reproducing doctoral 
dissertations has been sponsored by the 
Joint Committee. Dr. Stanton Davis of the 
Case School of Applied Science in Cleveland prepared by the liquid hectograph 
process an edition of fifty of a 350-page 
dissertation, "Pennsylvania Politics, 1860--62, at a unit cost of $1.95. Additional 
expenses for binding amounted to $32.50, 
and mailing to eighteen libraries cost 
$6.72. The reader may examine this work 
at one of the following libraries: 

- Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh 
- Cleveland Public Library 
- Columbia University Library 
- Duke University Library 
- Free Library of Philadelphia 
- Harvard College Library 
- Historical Society of Pennsylvania 
- Historical Society of Western Pennsylvania 
- Library of Congress 
- New York Public Library 
- Princeton University Library 
- University of California Library 
- University of Chicago Library 
- University of Pennsylvania Library 
- University of Pittsburgh Library
- University of Wisconsin Library 
- Western Reserve University Library 
- Yale University Library 

A few copies are available for sale at the 
Western Reserve University Bookstore at 
$3.00 (paper binding) and $3.75 (cloth 
binding). The hectograph costs, exclusive 
of binding and mailing, for an edition of
fifty were $47.10 more than the cost for a 
typescript copy and one carbon. {% include columnbreak.html canvas=112 col=2 %} 

The hectograph process is probably 
more serviceable, however, as a means of 
distributing the type of material that would 
otherwise be printed in pamphlet form or as 
articles in periodicals. No binding costs 
other than simple wire stapling need intervene to increase the charge upon the author; 
hectographed memoranda up to twenty or 
thirty pages in length would probably find 
their place of storage in a vertical file, 
An example of this use of the process is 
the reproduction by the Joint Committee office of Dr. Robert C. Binkley's thirty-four-page memorandum, "New Tools, New Recruits for the Republic of Letter," at a 
unit cost of $.17. 

Hectographing is not recommended as 
a means of preserving original source material because of the impermanence of the 
dye, which fades rapidly if exposed to sun- 
light for any length of time. However, the 
kind of monographic work that becomes out 
of date in thirty or forty years may be circulated in hectographed form without loss 
to scholarship from its impermanence. If a 
single standard carbon copy is made while 
typing the hectograph master sheet, this 
copy can be deposited and held for permanence. 

## III. Mimeograph Techniques: Mimeographing and Direct-Typing Offset Printing 

The mimeograph process multiplies 
typescript by means of a stencil printing 
surface on which the letters of the format 
copy are cut by the typewriter. The stencil is fastened on a cylinder and as 
sheets of paper are fed into the machine an 
impression is produced on the copy paper by 
the squeezing of ink through the abraded 
portions of the stencil. The equipment 
ranges in price from $30.00 to $375.00 for 
a hand-run machine and from $255.00 to 
$450.00 for an electrically operated model 
with an automatic feed. The preparation 
of the printing surface is almost as simple 
as ordinary typewriting, and the machine 
can be operated by the lowliest office boy, 
so that although this form of duplicating 
is commercialized by service agencies, almost every office of any size possesses a 
mimeograph of its own. Both costs and 
prices, therefore, must be analyzed for 
mimeograph work. 

The rotaprint and multilith have 
been briefly mentioned in Chapter III in {% include pagebreak.html canvas=113 %} connection with the discussion of photo-offset as a reprinting method. The press 
plates for reprinting are, of course, prepared photographically. But there is an 
alternative way of putting on such plates 
the format copy of the text to be reproduced: the metal sheets that are used on 
these small offset presses can be inserted 
in a typewriter as if they were sheets of 
paper, to receive typescript directly. The 
making of typescript books from press 
plates prepared in this manner is called 
"direct-typing" offset, as compared with 
photo-offset. Direct-typing offset is much 
less common than photo-offset but also much 
cheaper, and it is, therefore, worthy of 
consideration by any institution possessing sufficient resources to purchase a rotaprint or a multilith for either commercial or non-commercial use. For the benefit of owners and non-owners, both costs and 
prices will be quoted. 

From the standpoint of cost behavior, mimeographing and direct-typing 
offset are very closely related. They will, 
therefore, be referred to henceforth in 
this report as the "mimeograph" techniques, 
and their costs will be analyzed together. 

## Composition Cost Analysis 

It will be seen that the cost of 
the printing surface (or the area cost) for 
the mimeograph processes, whether of stencil 
or metal sheet, is considerably more than 
the cost of the printing surface used with 
the hectograph, and that it differs from 
ordinary paper in its physical character. 
There is, therefore, a greater likelihood 
in mimeographing than in hectographing that 
there will be three typing processes. The 
author will have a fair copy made from his 
draft copy, and then a format typing will 
be necessary to transfer the text to the 
metal sheet or stencil. This is not technologically necessary, for the typist could 
work directly from a draft copy to a mimeograph stencil; but this extra format typing 
is so often done that most of the quotations presuppose it. 

Precisely because the area cost is 
Significant in mimeographing, the problem 
of format must be studied; for it becomes 
important to lay down as much as possible 
on a given area, without unduly sacrificing 
legibility and beauty. But it goes with- 
out saying that any format differing from {% include columnbreak.html canvas=113 col=2 %} the usual one-column, six-line-to-the-inch, 
pica or elite typescript format will be 
more expensive to prepare. In estimating 
the average mimeographing costs, therefore, 
format typing will be charged at $.80 per 
1000 words in order to provide for the 
slowing up that is necessary to produce an 
unusual typescript page. The specifications for satisfactory mimeograph formats 
will be discussed in connection with area 
costs. 

## Area Costs and Format 

Mimeograph stencils are of five 
kinds and are sold in two standard sizes, 
8½″ x 11″ and 8½″ x 14″. The prices 
as standardized in the trade are given be- 
low. Bootleg dealers sometimes sell stencils manufactured in violation of patent 
rights at half these prices. The patent 
rights will expire within the next decade, 
but by that time technology may have moved 
far beyond the mimeograph. Large government orders are filled at discounts up to 
50% in competitive bidding.

The wax stencil is used for runs {% include pagebreak.html canvas=114 %} not exceeding 500. It cannot be saved, and 
more care is needed to produce a good copy 
with the wax stencil than with the mimeotype stencil. A sample of work done on a 
wax stencil is seen in Figure XXVII. The 
Cellotype stencil, a white stencil with a 
carbon back, is used when very high visibility is desired; the dermatype, a wet 
process stencil, is seldom used and is almost obsolete; the mimeotype stencil, referred to as the "universal stencil," is 
used for every purpose except the photographic work. The dermaprint stencil has 
been discussed at length in Chapter III.
 
There are two kinds of metal sheets 
that can be used directly in the typewriter---the rotaplate: and the multilith metal 
sheet. The claim is made that the multilith sheet can be used over again for about 
three times; the rotaprint people say that {% include columnbreak.html canvas=114 col=2 %} they have not found any process whereby the 
rotaplate can be used over again with satisfactory results.

FIGURE XXV 

Direct typing on a Rotaplate is done by using either 
a special Rotaprint carbon paper in the typewriter, a 
Rotaprint "G" ribbon, or a Royal Photo-offset typewriter 
using carbon ribbon which does not require any preparatory 
treatment, is placed in the typewriter the same as a sheet 
of paper. In the typing, a very light impression against 
the Rotaplate should be made; a hard platen that will give 
a sharp outline of the characters is best. Errors are corrected in the usual manner. 

When the typing is done, the sheet is dusted with a 
special Rotaprint powder. A small amount of liquid solution is then poured on the sheet and spread over the surface with a piece ef cotton. The excess fluid is wiped 
off, leaving a thin coating on the surface. The Rotaplate 
is now ready to be used on the machine. It can be filed 
indefinitely. 

One Rotaplate will make 25,000 or more copies. The 
Rotaplate used for this work costs $.20. 

This sample page of direct typing Rotaprint work can 
be compared with Figure XXVI, which illustrates direct 
typing on a Multilith machine. 

 {% include pagebreak.html canvas=116 %} 

 {% include pagebreak.html canvas=117 %} 

FIGURE XXVI 

This sample page demonstrates Multilith direct typing. This 
page was produced by direct typing on a Multilith Duplex plate, 
which requires no preparation to receive the image. A special 
carbon typewriter ribbon was then used and the typing was done in 
the usual manner. The plate was then run off on the Model 1200 
Multilith, at the speed of approximately 5,000 impressions per hour. 

The cost of the Duplex plate was $.25, but since it is possible 
to use both sides of the plate the cost is reduced to $.12½ per image. 
The solutions necessary to prepare the plate for running were $.02½ 
bringing the total cost of the printing surface to $.15 an image in 
this form. 

The surface of the duplex plate is also receptive to crayon, 
ink, and regular fabric typewriter ribbons of the proper inking. 
The surface of this plate can be used only once to each side. It is 
possible to obtain five to ten thousand impressions from the duplex 
plate. 

The Multilith Zinc plate, which has a grain on only one side, 
is also receptive to the above mentioned methods of direct work, after 
being treated with a solution of Deoxit. 

The cost of the zinc plate is $.35, but the surface of this 
plate can be cleaned, and re-employed three or four times. The plate 
is cleaned by applying a solution of Blankrolla to the surface to 
wipe out the first image. It is then resensitized with a solution 
of Deoxit. 

The life of the Multilith zinc plate direct image is from five to 
ten thousand impressions, but by the application of a solution called 
intensifier it can be extended from five to ten thousand impressions.

FIGURE XXVII 

This sample page is to illustrate the use of special interlinear spacing and the use of a wax stencil. The interlinear spacing used is five lines to the inch; the stencil used 
is the inexpensive wax stencil costing $.05¼ each, instead of 
the usual Mimeotype stencil costing $.13½ each. 

The length of run that is possible with the wax stencil 
is much less than that which can be obtained with the Mimeotype stencil, possibly 300 copies being the limit. 

The preparation of the wax stencil printing surface is 
no more difficult than the Mimeotype printing surface. The 
chief danger is the creasing of the wax sheet, which would result in ink being squeezed through the abraded parts. Corrections are made in the usual manner.

FIGURE XXVIII 

This is a sample page done with micro-elite type. In this format, 800 words are 
contained on one page. Compare this figure 
with Figure XXVII, containing 400 words per 
page and using special interlinear spacing. 

To mimeograph a book of 100,000 words 
in this format would mean tremendous savings 
in stencil cost and paper cost. Composition 
cost would, of course, be no less, and might 
even be somewhat more expensive, due to the 
two-column arrangement. 

The inference, of course, is obvious: 
there is a close tieup between cost and legibility. The more money that is put into a 
job, the more likely it is that the resulting product will have greater legibility and 
be more pleasing to the eve. This brings up 
the problem of how we are to determine the 
exact point at which cost, legibility, and 
beauty of appearance come together in the 
best balance. This problem has not yet received its final analysis. It is known, 
however, that beyond a certain point there 
is no need to spend more money for increased 
legibility, because the factor of legibility 
has already reached its maximum point, and a 
more expensive format would add to nothing 
except, perhaps, the printer's profit. 

In order to exhibit as many as possible 
of the different varieties of the mimeograph 
process, sample pages have been run off on 
various paper stocks from Rotaprint and Multilith metal sheets, and from Vimeotype and 
wax stencils. The reader must make allowance for the fact that paper stocks, formats 
and processes are all on display, and must 
decide for himself which differences in the 
sample pages are due to format variables, 
which to paper, and which to the reproduction methods.

The mimeograph process multiplies typescript by means of a stencil printing surface 9n which the letters of the format copy 
are cut by the typewriter; the stencil is 
fastened on a cylinder. and as sheets of papae are fed into the machine. an impression 
is produced on the copy paper by the squeezing of ink through the abraded portions of 
the stencil. Mimeograph equipment ranges in 
price from $30.00 to $375.00 for hand-run 
models, and from $255.00 to $450.00 for the 
electrically operated models with automatic 
feed. The preparation of the printing surface is almost as simple as ordinary tvpewriting, so that, although this form of duplication is commercially available through 
service agencies, almost every office of any 
size possesses its own Mimeograph machine. 

The Rotaprint and the Multilith have 
been mentioned in connection with the discussion of photo-offset as a reprinting 
method. The press plates for reprinting are 
prepared photographically, of course, but 
there is an alternative way of putting on 
such plates the format cooy of the text to 
be reproduced. The metal sheets that are 
used on these small offset presses can be 
inserted in a typewriter as if they were 
sheets of paper, to receive typescript directly. The making of typescript books from 
press plates prepared in this manner may 
perhaps be called "direct typing" offset, as 
compared with photo-offset. It is much less 
common than photo-offset, but also much less 
expensive, and it is therefore worthy of consideration by any institution possessing sufficient resources to purchase a Rotaprint or 
a Multilith for either commercial or non-commercial use. 

From the standpoint of cost behaviour, 
mimeographing and direct typing offset are 
very closely related. Thev will therefore 
be referred to in this report as the "mimeograph" techniques, and their costs will 
be analyzed together. 

This is a sample page done with micro-elite type. In this format, 800 words per 
page are accomodated. Compare this figure 
with Figure XXVII, containing 400 words per 
page and using special interlinear spacing. 

To mimeograph a book of 100,000 words 
in this format would mean tremendous sovings 
in stencil cost and paper cost. Composition 
cost would, of course, be no less, and might 
even be somewhat more expensive, due to the

be more pleasing to the eye. This brings up 
the problem of how we are to determine the 
exact point at which cost, legibility, and 

 {% include pagebreak.html canvas=122 %} 

 {% include pagebreak.html canvas=123 %} 

In designing a format for the maximum utilization of this surface five factors must be considered: 

| 1. Size of page | standard 8½″ x 11″<br/>legal 8½″ x 14″ | 
| 2. Size of type | pica<br/>elite |
| 3. Interlinear spacing | 3 lines to the inch<br/>6 lines to the inch<br/>4½, 5, and 5½ to the inch (special) | 
| 4. Length of line | 5 inches is a highly legible line<br/>6 inches is a normal office practice<br/>6½ inches is a crowded line | 
| 5. Top and bottom margin | 2″ at top and 2½″ at bottom is a wide margin<br/>¾″ at top and 1″ at bottom is a narrow margin |

By combining these factors in various ways, there might be constructed over 
fifty different typescript formats. The 
difference in word-carrying capacity between the two extremes is very great. A 
hundred thousand words would go on 123 pages 
of 6½″ x 14″ size, elite type, single 
spaced, 6½″ lines, narrow-margin format; 
but would require 562 pages of 8½″ by 
11″ size, pica type, double-spaced, 5″ 
lines, and a wide-margin format. 

By a combination of experiment and 
guesswork, the writers have reached the 
conclusion that the formats shown in 
Table XIX are advisable for the number of 
words per page indicated. 

## Explanation of Sample Pages and Cost Table 

In order to exhibit as many as possible of the different varieties of the 
mimeograph process, the sample pages following have been run off on mimeograph and 
bond paper of different weights, from rotaprint and multilith metal sheets and from 
wax and mimeotype stencils (Figures XXV to 
XXVIII). The reader must make allowance 
for the fact that paper stock, format, and 
process are all on display; and he must 
decide for himself which differences in 
the exhibits are due to format variables, 
which to paper, and which to the reproduc{%- include columnbreak.html canvas=123 col=2 -%}tion methods. 
He may also judge from these samples whether pica type with special spacing 
of five lines to the inch is not just as 
legible as pica with standard double spacing. From a theoretical standpoint, five 
lines to the inch should be wholly satisfactory. This would mean that nine vertical inches of mimeograph printing surface 
could just as well take forty-five lines 
at five lines to the inch, or forty lines 
at four and one-half lines to the inch, as 
to take the twenty-seven lines that ordinary double spacing offers. 

The five-lines-to-the-inch spacing 
would let twelve mimeograph stencils do 
the work of twenty stencils; the four-and- 
one-half-lines-to-the-inch spacing would 
let fourteen stencils do the work of twenty. The price of the special spacing 
equipment can be earned, therefore, by the 
economies in cost of stencils in a mimeographing job of less than 50,000 words.[^n1]

[^n1]: For prices of special spacing equipment, see Chapter IV.

The cost and prices of mimeographing a manuscript of 100,000 words in each 
of these formats are estimated in the following chart. But in order to make the 
comparison of formats very clear, the estimates in this case are based on the use 
of the same printing surface, namely, the 
ordinary 8½″ x 11″ mimeotype stencil, 
except with formats requiring 600 or 700 
words to a page, which require an 8½″ 
x 14″ stencil. In each case the cost figure is given under two alternative {% include pagebreak.html canvas=124 %}

hypotheses regarding composition cost: 
first, that the format copy is typed directly from the draft copy without an intervening fair copy; and second, that the 
fair copy is made on paper and then retyped as format copy on the mimeograph 
stencil. Labor for operating the duplicating machine is estimated at $.40 per hour. 
The choice of format would control a variation in area costs of 350% from the mini{%- include columnbreak.html canvas=124 col=2 -%}mum and a corresponding variation in running costs. (See Table XX on the following page.) 

These are costs based on average 
estimates for office work; prices vary 
greatly from this calculated cost basis. 
The comparison of cost and price, i.e., of 
work done in an office and work sent out, 
can be seen in one instance in the comparison as shown in Table XXI, page 52.  {% include pagebreak.html canvas=125 %}

## IV. Photo-Offset from Typescript 

The photo-offset technique has already been described in connection with the 
reprinting of books out of print. The same 
technique is available for the reproduction of typescript. Why should it be used, 
however, when typescript can be multiplied 
without an intervening photographic process? 

The difference between the direct 
and indirect making of a typescript printing surface can be illustrated in comparing the two possible ways of using the 
multilith. By the first method the typist 
takes a metal sheet, coats it with a preparatory solution, puts it into her typewriter exactly as if it were a piece of paper, 
types the text on it, clips it to the drum 
of the multilith and reproduces it. By the 
second method the typist makes a copy with 
a strong black ribbon on paper. An operator photographs this typescript page, securing a negative on film or paper---in this 
case usually paper. Then the photographic 
negative is laid on the metal, which has 
meanwhile been sensitized, and strong arc 
lights burn in the text from the photographic negative on to the metal plate. 
Then at last the metal plate is put on the 
drum, and the multiplying of copies can begin. The additional work increases not 
only the labor time but also the labor 
rate, because the additional photographic 
skill is necessary. Why should the costs 
of all these intermediate steps be borne? 
Why should the area cost be so greatly increased when the end product is still a 
typescript book? 

## Justification for Increased Area Cost 

If the text includes illustrations 
or characters that must be filled in by 
hand, or certain kinds of tabular or charted data, the reason for using the photographic step is clear. If, however, the 
text is simply typescript and nothing else, {% include columnbreak.html canvas=127 col=2 %} the justification of the extra cost must be 
found elsewhere. 

There are three reasons for incurring this additional area cost: first, the 
plates of the larger offset presses are too 
big to be put into the typewriter; second, 
the better photo-offset presses will distribute ink more evenly and make finer letters than the mimeograph techniques (including direct-typing offset) will produce; 
third, the standard typescript relations of 
type size, length of line, interlinear spacing, and size of page are not related to 
the normal 10″ spacing of library shelving 
in a way that results in the most efficient 
use of page areas and bookshelf footage. 

## Photographic Reduction of Typescript: (a) Economies in Type Size 

Typescript is wasteful of page 
areas because of the large size of the type. 
Photo-offset permits a photographic reduction of typescript in any degree.[^n2] Therefore, by the photo-offset process a typescript can be brought down to the equivalent of 8- and 10-point type as used in 
books, or to the equivalent of 7-point 
newsprint. A table of equivalents was suggested in Chapter IV, by which various reductions of typescript could be correlated 
with corresponding point sizes of book type 
by a photographic process. 

[^n2]: There is one process of photo-offset from typescript which does not permit enlargement or reduction. 
The typewriting is done on thin paper backed with carbon so that a heavy black letter, reinforced from 
the back, is made. The copy is then transferred to the photographic negative paper directly, without
using a camera. The National Process Company uses this method among others. From the standpoint of 
design of a typescript book format, its importance is only that it brings the photolithographic metal 
sheet nearer the typewriter. In this respect it is related to the rotaprint or multilith processes of 
direct typing on the metal. 

There has been one direct study of 
the legibility of reduced typescript by 
Professor Greene of Michigan. Professor 
Greene came to the conclusion that what he 
called "seven-point typewriter type" (i.e., 
pica typescript reduced to 70% of full size 
so that it laid down fourteen letters to 
the inch instead of ten) was just as legible as full-sized pica typescript.[^n3]

[^n3]: E. B. Greene, "The Legibility of Typewritten Material," *Journal of Applied Psychology*, XVII, No. 6 (December, 1933) 713-28. 

The reader should be given an opportunity to test this judgment and to compare 
the legibility of typescript in various reductions with the legibility of book-face 
type. To make the comparison possible, six {% include pagebreak.html canvas=128 %} areas of four square inches each are filled 
with reading matter (Figure XXIX). The 
first square is filled with text in 10-point type, and typescript that will lay 
down the same number of words in the same 
area is set beside it; the second pair of 
squares is filled with pica typescript reduced to 80% of normal size, and with ordinary printing in 7-point type, which fills 
the same area with the same number of words; 
the third pair of squares shows that pica 
typescript must be reduced to 70% of full 
size to put the same number of words in the 
area that will be put there by ordinary 
newsprint. The reader may judge the comparative legibilities. 

Whatever conclusions the reader may 
draw from these illustrations and from the 
exhibits of standard photo-offset typescript formats as to the permissible amount 
of reduction which pica typescript will 
take without sacrifice of legibility, the 
essential fact stands that reduction in 
size of typescript increases very rapidly 
the number of words that can be laid on a 
given page area. While the linear dimensions of the typescript are falling by an 
arithmetical ratio, the number of words per 
page is increasing by a geometrical ratio. 
This is the same situation that is encountered in any photographic reproduction 
process in which a reduction of the size of 
the writing is involved. 

## Photographic Reduction of Typescript: (b) Length of Line and Economy 

There is an additional feature that 
makes this consideration especially important in the case of typescript, and that is 
the effect of reduction on length of line. 
there is very little reason to carry out a 
reduction of typescript size if a single 
column of typescript is still to be carried 
on a sheet of paper 8½″ x 11″, because 
so much of what is gained in the use of 
space by diminishing the type size is simply turned over to wider margins. But here 
two possibilities intervene: the reading 
matter may be typed in two or more columns 
and reproduced on the standard typewriter 
size page, or the size of the page itself 
may be reduced to something more nearly resembling that of an ordinary octavo book. 

But since an octavo page, 6″ x 9″, 
with lines of maximum length (3.9″ for 6-- 
to 10--point type, according to Vernon) {% include columnbreak.html canvas=128 col=2 %} sacrifices 35% of its surface to right- and 
left-hand margins, an 8½″ x 11″ page, 
with two columns each 3 ¼″ wide, which 
sacrifices only 23½% to right- and left-hand margins, is preferable. The difference is increased by the fact that a larger 
side margin usually calls for larger top 
and bottom margins. Since the cost of 
printing surface is an area cost and the 
margin space costs just as much per square 
inch as the part of the page that is utilized for text, it is especially important 
in planning an economy format for a photo-offset typescript book that the margins 
shall not be made any larger than necessary.
It is interesting to note in this connection that Edwards Brothers propose, for an 
8½″ x 11″ page, a two-column format with 
columns 3½″ wide, and the Donnelley & 
Sons Company suggests a similar format. 

With these facts in mind, one may 
lay down the conditions under which it may 
be profitable to reproduce typescript by 
photo-offset rather than by the mimeograph 
process: by the increased utilization of 
paper and printing surface owing to reduction in size of type, and the diminution of 
the proportion of area given over to margins, the photo-offset process will at some 
point reach a cost figure that will make up 
for some of the additional costs of the 
photographic element in the process. If, 
for instance, the area cost of making a 
photo-offset page is three times the area 
cost of making a mimeograph page, the area 
cost per word will be the same only if six 
times as much reading matter can be put on 
the photo-offset page. 

## Specifications for Reproducing the Same Book at the Same Cost by Mimeographing and by Photo-Offset 

Cost comparisons between photo-offset and mimeographing as means of reproducing typescript are complicated by the 
fact that photo-offset is usually shopwork 
sent out on contract, and, therefore, costs 
to the publisher must be calculated on the 
basis of actual price quotations by firms 
engaged in the printing business; while the 
mimeograph process is so much a part of office routine that its costs can be calculated in terms of labor and materials. The 
most appropriate comparisons, therefore, are 
those that stand between commercial mimeographing as quoted by office service shops%nbsp;{%- include pagebreak.html canvas=129 %}

and commercial photo-offset quotations. 

A further complication increasing 
the difficulty of cost comparison is the 
fact that any format devised to secure a 
maximum use of the paper surface is likely 
to require a special format typing; the 
fair-copy typing operation cannot so easily be merged with the format-copy typing as 
in the processes which use a simpler format. In both cases, therefore, the cost of 
a format typing from the fair copy will be 
figured into the estimates made. 

An extra operation required to 
justify the right-hand margin also calls 
for calculation, whether the method used 
should be that of a second format typing 
or the special paper invented by Spielvogel 
(see Chapter IV). The cost of this operation will not be figured into the estimates. 

Taking all of these factors into 
account, it seems that mimeographing 50,000 
words in a format that permits 300 words to 
the 8½″ x 11″ page would cost about the 
Same as reproducing the same number of 
words by photo-offset in a format that reproduces 1786 words to the 8½″ x 11″ 
page. 

As in all problems of reproducing 
research materials, the rule holds that between certain limits an increase in attractiveness of text and format accompanies an 
increase in cost. Above the level at which 
photo-offset typescript costs the same as 
mimeographing, there are other photo-offset 
formats available at costs that increase 
until they come to exceed the cost of efficiency formats in printing. 

## Photo-Offset Typescript Format: Full Utilization of Printing Surface 

In planning formats for the photo-offset book there must be considered a 
fixed set of dimensions not those of the 
typewriter page--namely, the dimensions of 
a metal sheet of the offset press. Though 
Commercial quotations often ignore this 
factor, it actually enters into the cost in 
avery material way, for whenever a format 
is so designed that it fails to use the 
full available printing surface of the 
photo-offset metal sheet, energy and material are wasted. The sensitizing and preparation of the metal sheet are substantially 
the same whether all or merely a part of 
the surface is used; the waste that occurs {% include columnbreak.html canvas=131 col=2 %} when the page is not planned to fit the 
metal sheet has been discussed in Chapter 
III in connection with reprinting. 

The ideal typescript format, from 
the standpoint of printshop efficiency, 
would be based on a page size that would 
divide evenly into the area of one of the 
larger press plates. The plates most commonly in use will take paper sheets of the 
following dimensions: 

- 22″ x 34″
- 28″ x 42″ 
- 35″ x 45″
- 36″ x 48″ 
- 38″ x 50″
- 44″ x 64″ 
- 59″ x 72″

The printers will sometimes say 
that they are controlled by the standard 
sizes in which book paper is available, 
and that it will not pay to print in any
format that calls for cutting off and wasting any considerable portion of their 
standard paper sheets, which are usually: 

- 17″ x 22″
- 25″ x 38″
- 28″ x 42″ 
- 32″ x 44″ 
- 35″ x 45″ 
- 38″ x 50″ 
- 42″ x 56″
- 36″ x 48″ 

This consideration is of great importance in the case of a long run, but if 
only 200 or 300 copies of a book are desired, the cost of the paper is so slight 
an element in the total cost that paper 
economy may in some cases be sacrificed in 
the interest of printing surface economy. 

The relative importance of economies in utilization of metal sheet area and 
economies in utilization of paper is established by the fact that the first is a saving in area cost, the second a saving in 
running cost. The smaller the edition, 
the larger is the proportion of area cost 
and the smaller the proportion of running 
cost, and hence of cost of paper. In the 
small editions---around 100---the area cost 
so far preponderates over running cost 
that some firms give the same quotation for 
100 copies as for 50 copies. In such 
editions wasteful use of paper is {% include pagebreak.html canvas=132 %} justified if it will bring equivalent economies in the use of the photo-offset metal 
sheet. The exact point at which it will 
cease to pay to waste paper for the sake of 
saving metal sheet printing surface can always be calculated by estimating the total 
price of the paper wasted and comparing it 
with the area cost saved. 

What then is an ideal format for 
the photo-offset typescript book? The 
standard octavo printing formats (according to published figures on binding) of 
6″ x 9″ and 6 ¼″ x 9 ¼″ are ill adapted 
to offset work because they lead either to 
an undue extent of margin, an undue length 
of line, or an inadequate use of the reducing power of the photographic process. A 
column of maximum width (3.9″) can be 
printed in the 5½″) x 8½″ page with
only 42.4% of the area surrendered to margins, but this volume is too small for convenient library shelving. The best format 
for library shelving convenience and low 
margin ratio would be just short of 10″ 
high, and the narrowest page that would accept two columns would be 7 ¾″ wide. Such 
a page would take two columns of minimum 
width (2.9″) with ½″ between them, and 
external margins of about ¾″, The percentage of area given over to margins would 
be about 26%. The book page would have an 
unusual appearance---more nearly square than 
an ordinary octavo page. Yet it would be 
very efficient (Figure XXX). 

Now the curious fact emerges that 
despite all the variety of sizes available 
in photo-offset press, there is none that 
will take without waste of printing surface al page 9 ¾″ x 7 ¾″. Thus the limitations of equipment impose themselves in 
planning a model photo-offset page. 

Planning a photo-offset page is 
more intricate than planning a mimeograph 
page because, while all the variants of 
length of line, interlinear spacing, margins, size of type, and number of columns 
are present, there are added the additional factors of a photographic reduction ratio and a layout on a photo-offset metal 
sheet. The format copy is typed on one 
size of page, the book appears in another 
size of page. Moreover, while the use of 
book type in planning a page has been made 
the subject of much study, the use of typescript with photo-offset has been left to 
rule of thumb. {% include columnbreak.html canvas=380 col=2 %}

To illustrate the planning of a 
photo-offset page, an exercise is here carried out in calculating a format for a book 
of 50,000 words to meet two different cost 
situations: first, to cost as much in an 
edition of 500 as low-cost printing; second, to cost as much in an edition of 500 
as medium-cost mimeographing. By consulting the tables in Chapter III, it appears 
that an edition of this size, in an "economy format," can be printed at $365.00 
(6 ¾″ x 9½″ page size, two columns); 
and the same text, mimeographed in a 400-word format, will cost $158.00 (see page 51). 

The question may then be asked, is 
photo-offset as expensive as printing? Is 
it as cheap as mimeographing? The answer 
is that it is both, and that the cost depends on the format. The format is itself 
the determinant of legibility, and anyone 
with a typewriter and a supply of paper can 
plan a format that will meet any price 
level from the lowest to the highest. 

The general formula for finding a 
photo-offset format that will reproduce a 
given number of words for a given sum of 
money in an edition of a given size can be 
worked out from data already presented in 
this volume. 

Given N (a number of words) and D 
(a sum of money available), from the information in Chapter IV on costs of typing, 
calculate the cost of making a format copy 
of this number of words, which will be D'
(the composition cost). D minus D' will be 
available for photo-offset work---the area 
and running cost. From the tables in Chapter III, calculate the number and size of 
photo-offset pages that can be produced in 
the required number of copies for D minus 
D' dollars. Then lay off on these pages 
the desired margins, make a decision on the 
number of columns of print, and conclude 
with the dimensions in inches of space to 
be filled with text. Let L be the length 
of the column, W the width of the column, 
P the number of pages, and C the number of 
columns to a page. 

N/CP is the number of words per 
column. The type of text may lead to the 
conclusion that the number of keystrokes 
per word is greater or smaller than six, 
but six can be taken as a good average. To 
keep the formula perfectly general, however, 
let K be the number of keystrokes per word 
(including allowance for inter-word spacing {% include pagebreak.html canvas=133 %}

A PROJECT FOR THE REPRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION OF   
MATERIALS FOR RESEARCH IN SMALL EDITIONS   
under consideration by the   
Joint Committee on Materials for Research   
of the   
American Council of Learned Societies   
and the   
Social Science Research Council 

</div>

I. The Problem. 

The term, materials for research, is 
here understood to refer to materials of 
three types: (1) reprints of out-of-print 
or rare items, --- books, pamphlets, newspaper or periodical files; (2) source material of considerable bulk, which in most 
cases would be copied and edited, but in 
some cases, merely reproduced in facsimile; (3) the original work of scholars, 
generally in the form of monographs. 

Such materials for research are at 
present published by agencies of three 
types, each specializing in publications 
for which a sale of different size may be 
expected: (1) commercial publishers ordinarily issue books of which a thousand 
or more copies will be sold; (2) university presses specialize in books with a 
total sale averaging less than a thousand 
copies; (3) learned societies for the most 
part issue books with a total sale of 
less than three hundred copies. 

Since the cost of printing materials 
for research can seldom be covered by a 
sale of less than four hundred copies at 
normal prices (1.2 cents per page, or 375 
words for a cent), almost all such publications as the learned societies now issue 
must be subsidized, usually to the extent 
of two-thirds of their cost. Books issued 
by the university presses, of which as 
many as six hundred copies are sold, must {% include columnbreak.html canvas=133 col=2 %} also ordinarily be subsidized, to the extent of one-third of their cost. Nor is 
the need for subsidies confined to agencies 
of the second and third types: commercial
publishers have frequently found it necessary to ask subsidies for books for which 
a sale of a thousand copies cannot be anticipated. In fact, experience has shown 
that the publication of materials for research is seldom possible at present without a subsidy to cover at least a part of 
the loss incurred. 

The small sale for these publications 
is probably due in the last analysis to 
the rapid advance of specialization, which 
has so far removed from general knowledge 
publications that are essential to further
advance as to restrict their appreciation 
to specialists. But the restricted market 
that they might command is still further 
diminished by the apparent preference of 
American scholars for depending on libraries to obtain the materials they need, 
rather than for purchasing them for personal use. So long as this preference prevails, provision will have to be made for 
reproducing and distributing materials for 
research in the small editions that the 
market can absorb, if material essential 
to the progress of research is to be made 
available for the use of scholars. 

For most publications of this kind, 
subsidies will in any case be necessary, 

FIGURE XXX

 {% include pagebreak.html canvas=135 %} 

and loss of keystrokes at the uneven right-hand margin). Then NK/CP is the number of 
keystrokes per column. 

The formula for making NK/CP keystrokes on a reduced size (or enlarged size) 
photo-offset column of given dimensions 
L x W inches can be worked out for any 
typewriter. 

Let A be the number of keystrokes 
per inch laid down by the typewriter (so 
that with a pica machine, A equals 10; 
with an elite machine, A equals 12; with a 
micro-elite machine, A equals 14; with a 
"nine-pitch" machine, A equals 9); and let 
B stand for the number of lines to the 
inch (which with ordinary single spacing is 
six, with double spacing is three, and 
with special spacings may be four, four and 
one-half, five, and five and one-half). 

Given chosen values for A and B, it 
remains to find W' and L', the width and 
length of the original typescript copy of 
a column from which the photo-offset page 
is to be photographically copied, in a reduction ratio or enlargement ratio which 
will have the value R. 

$$ {W \over L} = {W' \over L'} $$; and $$ {AW' \times BL'} = {NK \over CP} $$. $$ {L'} = {NKL \over CPABW } $$; $$ W' = {NKW \over CPABLE } $$; therefore, $$ {L \over L'} = {W \over W'} = R $$.

 {% include columnbreak.html canvas=135 col=2 %}  The composition costs of typescript 
books, it has been proved, are highly variable; the principal levels for a book of 
50,000 words are determined by the five 
situations shown in Table XXIII. 

To simplify cost calculations, composition cost will be taken for the third 
situation only---i.e., for typing done by a 
typing bureau at an average price. The 
typescript composition cost for photo-offset will therefore stand at $62.50 for 
50,000 words. Although the differences in 
format will react upon this composition 
cost in some measure, this influence will 
be ignored. Substracting, then, the composition cost from the two total sums suggested as alternatives (i.e., price of a 
mimeographed and price of a printed book), 
the following amounts remain for the production of a photo-offset book, exclusive 
of typing:

|----|----:|----|
| Photo-offset price to equal mimeographing | $158.00 | |
| less composition cost | 62.50 | |
| leaves | 95.50 | for photo-offset metal sheets and press work. |

|----|----:|----|
| Photo-offset price to equal mimeographing | $365.00 | |
| less composition cost | 62.50 | |
| leaves | 302.50 | for photo-offset metal sheets and press work. |

| 4. | When format copying is charged by shop in connection with manufacturing job quotation (composite quotation) | $75.00 |

 {% include pagebreak.html canvas=136 %} In Chapter III area costs of photo- 
offset work are found. These indicate that 
the sums listed above will purchase the 
following amounts of page area in a photo-offset edition of 500 copies: 

For $95.50 can be bought 500 copies 
of twenty-eight pages, 8½″ x 11″, which 
will require 1786 words to a page to reproduce 50,000 words; or, $95.50 will buy 500 
copies of forty-four pages, 6″ x 9½″ 
(twenty-two printings from a metal sheet 
9½″ x 12″), which will require 1136 
words per page to reproduce 50,000 words. 

How can the typescript copy be prepared to lay this number of words on a page 
in a format satisfactory for photo-offset 
in these sizes of metal sheet or paper? 

The arrangement of 6″ x 9½″, 
less ½″ margin on top, bottom and outside, and with a ¾″ margin on the bound 
edge, can be made in this manner: two 
columns, each column 8½″ high, carrying 
568 words, in column width not greater than 
2 ⅛″, leaving ½″ between columns. Such 
a column will roughly resemble newsprint 
in width. Counting 6 keystrokes per word 
to allow for spacing and loss on the right-hand margin, the number of keystrokes must 
be 3408 in a column 8½″ x 2 ⅛″. An 
interlinear spacing of five lines to the 
inch with pica type would be used. 

In full pica size, 8½″ will be 
filled with forty-two lines at five lines 
to the inch, and 2 ⅛″ with 21 keystrokes; 
at full size, therefore, this area will accept 882 keystrokes. But since it must accept 5408 keystrokes in reduced size, the 
reduction must be such that four times this 
number of keystrokes will go on this area. 
The square root of four is two. The pica 
typescript must, therefore, stand at a reduction of two diameters. Since 42 keystrokes reduced two diameters will fill the 
2⅛″ column, the typewriter should be 
set to make columns of this width (42 keystrokes, or 4.2″) and carried to a column 
length of 17″. When this is reduced photographically, it is a reduction of approximately 50%. (Figure XXXI.) 

In the 8½″ x 11″ size of page 
the necessary 1786 words would probably 
best be set in three columns. Making margin allowances of ¾″ inside margin, ½″ 
between columns and for outer margin, and 
1″ on the top and bottom, the effective 
width of the columns would be 2.08″ and the {% include columnbreak.html canvas=136 col=2 %} height would be 9″. Each column would be 
required to take 595 words, or 3570 keystrokes. A reduction ratio of 50% will be 
necessary. Pica typescript reduced to 50% 
of original size will suffice in this format. In the format copying, the typist 
should make each line 43 keystrokes long 
(4.3″) and the column should be typed to 
18″ in height. (Figure XXXII.) 

Thus it appears that there are at 
least two formats in which a photo-offset 
copy of a 50,000-word text could be made 
for a price equivalent to the cost of a 
mimeograph copy. The choice of an 8½″ 
x 11″ format would involve reduction of 
pica typescript by 50%; the choice of the 
6″ x 9½″ format would also mean a reduction of 50%. The typescript format copy 
for the 6″ x 9½″ page could be prepared 
on a typewriter with a 12″-carriage (two 
columns, each column 4.2″, with ½″ margin between them); the format copy for the 
8½″ x 11″ page would call for a typewriter carriage that would make three columns, each 4.5″, with two internal margins 
of ½″, and hence a 15″-carriage would be 
necessary. Of course the typing could be 
done one column at a time on the typewriter, 
and the columns then mounted together to 
make the format copy. 

The essential significance of this 
whole demonstration is, first, that photo-offset formats can be designed to bring 
photo-offset costs down to the level of 
mimeographing; and second, that when formats are so designed to bring the photo-offset costs to this level, the legibility 
diminishes below that of the corresponding 
mimeograph copy. Pica typescript reductions of 50% are close to the lower limit 
of legibility without a reading glass. 

If the composition cost is set at a 
lower level by basing it upon a wage rate 
in an office, the number of 8½″ x 11″ 
pages upon which the 50,000 words would be 
spread would be increased from twenty-eight 
to thirty-two, because there would be more 
money left over from typescript composition 
to pay for the photo-offset work. It would 
then be necessary to put only 1560 words on 
a page instead of 1786, only 520 words in a 
column instead of 595. This could be accomplished by reducing the typescript only 
47%, to 53% of its full size.

It often happens that a manuscript 
is submitted to a photo-offset shop and a {% include pagebreak.html canvas=137 %}

This page illustrates a photo-offset 
format that has been designed to conform to 
the cost levels of medium-priced mimeographing. The essential significance of 
this page is to show that (a) photo-offset 
costs can be brought down to the level of 
mimeographing, and (b) when photo-offset

their legibility diminishes below that of 
the corresponding mimeograph copy. To 
demonstrate this fact, the reader is asked 
to compare this page with Figure XXVII, a 
mimeograph format that is in the same cost 
range. A book of 50,000 words, reproduced 
in this format, would cost $158.00, including the cost of typing the master copy. Allowing $62.50 for the composition cost, a 
sum of $95.50 is left to pay for the running costs. This amount of money will buy 
500 copies of forty-four pages, size 6″ 
x 94″, To put 50,000 words on forty-four 
pages, there must be 1136 words on a page, 
or 568 words per column in a two-column 
format such as this one. 

To fit these specifications, the master copy is typed in two columns, each column being 4.4″ wide and 17″ long. Pica 
type with an interlinear spacing of five 
lines to the inch is used. The master copy 
is then given to the photo-offset establishment with instructions that it is to be 
reduced 50%. This sample page illustrates 
the appearance of the final product. The 
reader may judge for himself the diminishing curve of legibility as the amount of 
money available for running costs decreases. 
This extremely low-priced photo-offset format may be compared with a medium-priced 
mimeographing format which also costs 
$158.00 for 50,000 words.

Again, as has been explained in the 
text, it is possible to give a larger proportion of the $158.00 to the running costs 
by either doing the typing personally and 
not counting the cost in, or by having it 
done by cheap labor. However, it is 
quite possible that the typing would be of 
such inferior quality that the amount 
saved for running costs would be much better spent for composition. 

This format again illustrates the saving that is made possible by the use of a 
special spacer. Five lines to the inch is 
used for this format, instead of the usual 
six lines to the inch (regular single 
spacing) which is too crowded for good 
legibility, or the three lines to the inch 
(regular double spacing) which is too widespread to be economical.

of 50,000 words or for the photo-offsetting of 50,000 words in this format, is 
probably best used for the mimeograph.

This photo-offset page is made up in a format that costs 
the same to reproduce as an economical print format. The 
$365.00 that would be required to print 50,000 words is here 
devoted to making a photo-offset reproduction from typescript. 
$62.50 of it is allotted to the composition cost, leaving 
$302.50 to pay for the running costs. This amount will buy 
500 copies of sixty-nine pages, 93″ x 12″, or, as with this 
format, 138 pages, 6″ x 9½″. With the larger size page, only 
725 words need be put on each page; with this 6″ x 9½″ page, 
only 363 words need be put on each page. 

Leaving wide margins and typing in a single column with 
four-lines-to-the-inch spacing, a reduction of 33% takes care 
of the word content. The resulting page is a very legible 
and very expensive way of putting the photo-offset process 
into use. 

If it should happen that the format copy were then sent 
to a photo-offset printer for quotation who was using a press 
with a 17″ x 22″ metal sheet, his quotation for the job would 
be substantially higher than the figure of $302.50 that is 
the basis of this calculation, because he would have to run 
the whole printing surface to get four pages of 6″ x 9½″, 
and the wastage of his metal sheet printing surface would be 
almost 40%. This fact is brought into the picture to emphasize the importance of considering, in the planning of a format, not only the arrangement of typescript columns that will 
lay the required number of words on a page, but also the relation of the page size chosen to the dimensions of the metal 
sheet of the press upon which it is to be run.

The balance of the account, $190.00, is the correct wage expense for the new pe 
riod. | 
Other examples of accrued expenses are advertising, commissions, interest, sal 
aries, workmen's compensation insurance; also the utility services, gas, electricity, 
and water. 
Adjusting entries for accrued expenses are necessary, for, without such adjust 
ments: 


- the expenses of the period will be understated, 

- the net income overstated, and 

- the balance sheet will be incorrect because of the omis-— 
sion of accrued expenses from its liability side. 


DEFERRED INCOME 

Some incomes may be recorded on the books before they are earned. Suppose foi 
instance, that an insurance company credits Insurance Income for an initial annual pre 
mium of $2,400.00, which it receives on December 1, from a new policy holder. When tl 
books are closed December 31, it would not be correct to consider all of the $2,400.00 
as income earned in the period ending that date. This is because the insurance prote 
tion is rendered not for one month but for twelve months. It follows that since ¹⁄₁₂ | 
the insurance protection is rendered during December, ¹⁄₁₂ of the income, or $200.00, 
should be credited to that month. The remaining ¹¹⁄₁₂ths, or $2,200.00, should be cret 
ited to the income of the new year. . 

A statement of principle may therefore be made: income which has been record 
on the books but which is, in whole, or in part, unearned income at the end of an ac-— 
counting period, should be removed from the income account of the -current period and ¢ 
ried forward to the next period as unearned, or deferred, income. The accounting en 
tries are as follows: 

Income accounts are debited with the amowmt to be deferred, and the credits ar 
made either to separate liability accowmts,--one account for each type of deferred in 
come,--or to one summary account called Deferred Income. The latter method is ordina- 
rily to be preferred. Unless further-other adjustments are necessary, the income ac- 
counts are closed to Profit and Loss, and the account with Deferred Income is carried 
to the balanee sheet as a liability. It is a liability because it isvan oplipation 
which is payable, not in cash, but in services.

 {% include pagebreak.html canvas=147 %} printing shop for quotations, and that the 
quotations for a printed product are about 
the same as those for a photo-offset book 
from typescript. This is invariably the 
result of the choice of format for the 
photo-offset book. The printing prices, as 
has been proved in Chapter III above, cannot respond as actively to change in format as the photo-offset prices. To ask "is 
photo-offset as expensive as printing?" is 
to avoid the essential element in photo-offset pricing, namely area cost and reduction ratio of the typescript. By calculations corresponding to those used above, 
it is easy to determine a format in which a 
typescript book, reproduced in 500 copies 
by photo-offset, will cost as much as the 
same book reproduced in print. 

If the $365 that would be required 
to print 50,000 words is devoted to making 
a photo-offset reproduction from typescript, 
$62.50 of it must be allotted to typescript 
composition, leaving $302.50 to pay for the 
photo-offset work itself. This will pay 
for 500 copies of 69 pages, 9½″ x 12″, 
or 138 pages, 6″ x 9½″. It would be 
necessary to put no more than 725 words on 
each 9½″ x 12″ page, or 368 words on 
each 6″ x 9½″ page. Leaving wide margins and typing in a single column with 
five-lines-to-the-inch spacing, a reduction 
of 24%, to 76% of full size, would take 
care of the 9½″ x 12″ page. The typist 
would simply set the stops to write 85 keystrokes to a line (8.56″), type 60 lines on 
a page, and ask the photo-offset printer to 
reduce the page to 76% of full size. On 
the 6″ x 9½″ page, the typist would set 
the stops to write 54 to 55 keystrokes, 
type 47 lines at four-lines-to-the-inch 
Spacing, and ask the printer to reduce it 
33% to 67% of full size. (See Figure 
XXXIII.) The resulting pages would be very 
neat, very legible, and a very expensive 
way of using the photo-offset process. 

If it should happen that the format 
copy were then sent for quotation to a 
photo-offset printer who was using a press 
with a 17″ x 22″ metal sheet, his quotation 
for the job would be substantially higher 
than the figure of $302.50 that is the basis of this calculation, because he would 
_have to run the whole 17″ x 22″ to get four 
pages 6″ x 9½″, and the wastage of his 
metal sheet printing surface would be almost 40%. This fact is brought into the {% include columnbreak.html canvas=147 col=2 %} picture to emphasize the importance of considering, in the planning of a format, not 
only the arrangement of typescript columns 
that will lay the required number of words 
on a page, but also the relation of the 
page size chosen to the dimensions of the 
metal sheet of the press upon which it is 
to be run. 

In the first edition of this manual, 
the writer gathered quotations on the manufacture of photo-offset typescript books 
and fitted them to a chart in which they 
were compared to the manufacturing prices 
of printed books. It has become evident, 
as a result of further study, that this way 
of presenting the comparison is completely 
misleading because it ignores the vital factor of format. Therefore, in this analysis 
of the use of photo-offset to reproduce 
typescript, several formats are designed, 
and the manufacturing prices of a book in 
each format are calculated. These prices 
are sufficiently checked with actual quotations to make them indicative of the general price levels at which photo-offset can 
be used. (See Figures XXXIV and XXXV.) 

## Photo-Offset from Normal Fair Copy, without Additional Format Typing 

It will often happen that a fair 
copy of a manuscript has been made in the 
ordinary typescript format, 300 words to 
the page. This question then arises: shall 
the text be retyped as a special format 
copy for photo-offset reproduction, or shall 
the fair copy be used as a format copy? 
This is a special case of the problem of 
controlling typescript composition costs by 
merging fair and format typing operations. 
It can now be given a specific answer. 

A manuscript of 50,000 words, typed 
in the normal 300-word format, fills 166 
pages. To retype this manuscript in a special format for photo-offset reproduction 
would cost $62.50. Now this $62.50, if diverted from the payment of composition cost 
to the payment of area cost, will buy nineteen extra pages, 8½″ x 11″, or 28 
extra pages, 6″ x 9½″, in an edition of 500. If this $62.50, instead of going to 
composition, is actually paid to the offset 
printer, the text can be spread over this 
additional amount of page area without 
changing the total cost of the edition. The 
additional page area released to the photo-offset by an elimination of the retyping {% include pagebreak.html canvas=148 %} process is the same, regardless of the total amount spent for the publication. 
Whether the book is to be published for 
$158.00 or for $365.00, it will still be 
true that the money diverted from composition cost will buy exactly the same amount 
of additional photo-offset surface. 

Will it pay to make this diversion? Will retyping so greatly increase 
the efficiency in the use of photo-offset 
page area as to justify reducing the number of available pages upon which the text 
is to be reproduced? This special case of 
the fair copy-format copy problem is particularly important, because the 300-word format is the normal one in which typescripts 
are prepared, and in which they are presented to editors or bound as typescript 
dissertations. 

It has been shown above that the 
50,000 word text can be retyped and reproduced in a 6″ x 9½″ or an 8½″ x 11″ 
book for $158.00 (the same price as mimeographing) by reducing the pica typescript 
to 50%. of full size. 

If the entire $158.00 is spent for 
photo-offset work, it will buy six full 
sheets 22″ x 34″ ($153.66). These six 
sheets will divide into 168 pages of 5½″ 
x 4 ⁶⁄₇″. This particular way of folding 
the sheet will cause an additional expense 
in gathering, but the extra expense will 
probably not exceed the difference between 
$153.66 and $158.00. The normal typescript 
pages, reduced to go on pages of this size, 
must pass through a reduction of 45%, leaving them 55% of full size. The page would 
then have a ½″ margin top and bottom, and 
side margins of nearly an inch. This reduction ratio would be the same if the 
typescript pages were reduced to go on 
pages 5½″ x 4 ¼″, made by folding 
8½″ x 11″ sheets into four, and costing, 
for the edition, $133.40. The difference 
between $133.40 and $153.66 would be an unnecessary expense for needless width of 
side margins. The alternatives in the 
"near-print" reproduction of a fair copy 
of normal typescript are therefore: 

1. To retype and mimeograph ($158.00) 
2. To photo-offset without retyping, reducing to 55% of full size ($133.40) {% include columnbreak.html canvas=148 col=2 %} 
3. To retype and photo-offset, reducing to 50% of full size 
($158.00). 

Another standard price level is suggested by the dimensions and word count of 
the normal typescript page, because of the 
importance of utilizing the full area of 
the photo-offset metal sheet. This is the 
size 8½″ x 5½″, obtained by reducing 
a full page of typescript to a half page of 
photo-offset. Metal sheets that will take 
an 8½″ x 11″ page without wastage will 
also take the 8½″ x 5½″ without wastage. If top and bottom margins of ¾″ are 
left on the photo-offset page, the reduction of the typescript will be 23%, to 77% 
of full size, and the cost of the edition 
of 500 will be $265.00. This is a price 
level at which the innumerable bound theses 
that fill the shelves of graduate schools 
could be brought conveniently into print 
without retyping. 

If the sum of $265.00) is to be 
spent to reproduce typescript in a retyped 
format, it can be made to yield a two-column page 8½″ x 11″, with each column 
3.6″ wide, and ½″ margins top and bottom, 
in exactly the same reduction, namely 23%. 

*Therefore the cost of reproducing 
a typescript by photo-offset in a reduction of 23% would be the same, whether or 
not the additional format typing were 
done.*[^n4] The saving of page area involved 
in shifting from one column to two, and 
from normal double spacing to special spacing four and one-half-to-the-inch, and 
from the ¾″ to the ½″ top and bottom 
margin, would exactly pay the cost of the 
format typing. 

[^n4]: The typing instructions for preparing this format page are: pica type, special spacing of 4½-to-the-inch, in columns 4.8″ (or 48 letters) wide, and 13″ (or 68 lines) long. 

These figures make possible an interesting comparison with the actual price 
quotations offered by Edwards Brothers. 
Edwards Brothers offer to type and manufacture an edition of 500 copies of 50,000 
words for $265.00. The calculations above 
and the format designed above to bring a 
retyped book to the same price of manufacture as a book reproduced directly from a 
normal fair copy of 8½″ x 5½™ photo-offset pages, are based on an average quotation for typing and on the photo-offset 
shop quotations made by Hoch. The agreement with the Edwards figures seems very 
near, for it would appear that Edwards {% include pagebreak.html canvas=149 %} Brothers would also find a point where the 
economies of a compressed format on a page 
would make up for the extra cost of a format typing. The reduction in both cases is 
not far from 25% (30%, 23%).  

The prices charged by Edwards 
Brothers have been widely published in two {% include columnbreak.html canvas=149 col=2 %} pamphlets: *Junior Models for Lithoprinting*, and *Manual of Lithoprinting*. These 
quotations are listed herewith: the figures 
for price of edition and price per page 
have been calculated by the author from the
Edwards figures.

 {% include pagebreak.html canvas=150 %} The Edwards' model 700-D requires 
seventy-two pages for the 50,000 words; the 
Edwards! quotations for typing in this format are $.78 per 1000 words instead of the 
$1.25 which is the average figure. The composition cost is figured at $39.00 for the 
700-D model with 50,000 words. The price 
of an edition of 500 copies typed by the 
author is $225.00; the price of an edition 
typed at the shop is about $39.00 more (or 
$264.00). Edwards quotes $265.00 for the 
shop-typed copy. 

There are other contrasts to be examined. The Hoch quotations for 500 copies 
are page 6½″ x 11″ stand at $5,205 
Edwards prints this amount of matter, collates, and includes a cheap binding for 
$3.68. But the Hoch quotations show a constant proportionate relationship between 
the prices of full metal sheets and half 
sheets. If Edwards Brothers sets up the 
8½″ x 11″ area in the form of two pages, 
8½″ x 5½″, the price is equivalent to 
$3.92 instead of Hoch's $3.20. Of course 
the collating and binding cost counts for 
something in this comparison, but the figures reveal nonetheless a certain elasticity in costs per square inch of page (area 
costs) and in running cost behavior. 

The buyer of photo-offset service 
can conclude from these illustrations that 
it is wise to secure quotations separated 
into the three parts: 

1. Area costs (page area chosen to fit metal sheets) 
2. Running costs (quoted as a constant figure per additional hundreds of copies) 
3. Typing costs (quoted in thousands of words, or in pages of a specific format) 

With these quotations in hand, he 
can divide the work and plan his format to 
produce maximum legibility at minimum cost. 

## Typing Instructions 

Since these tables reveal a considerable difference in costs and prices dependent upon the character of a composition cost, instructions for the preparation 
of a format copy for the photo-offset typescript book are properly a part of this 
chapter. 

Since the typescript copy must be a 
photographic object it should be as black 
as possible. Some companies recommend the {% include columnbreak.html canvas=150 col=2 %} use of a special bronze ribbon; in all cases 
the ribbon should be fresh and black. To 
avoid an uneveness in the impression produced by the fabric of the typewriter ribbon a special silk ribbon or one made of 
carbon paper may be used. The typewriter 
type must be perfectly clean and the touch 
of the typist even; the Electromatic typewriter may be used to great advantage here. 

Format instructions as to line 
length, interlinear spacing, etc., are most 
easily followed out if paper with a printed 
margin line can be provided, clearly designating the typing area. Photo-offset 
printers often provide such sheets. With 
paper so marked, and with the right ratchet 
and ribbon on the typewriter, and the right 
paper on the roller, any standard typewriter and any normally efficient typist should 
be able to turn out superior work. 

There are two ways of preparing 
typescript for the two-column page. The 
copy can be typed directly on a large sheet 
marked off into two columns or upon a long 
one-column galley, to be cut and fastened 
on the two-column page backing with rubber 
cement. The former is perhaps the better 
method in handling copy which is absolutely 
"straight"---no footnotes, no illustrations, 
no probability of author's revisions. But 
if the design of the page requires so many 
letters per column that the two columns 
cannot be typed together on the normal 10″-carriage, or if there is a prospect of many 
corrections or of footnote material to be 
fitted in place, the galley strip method of 
typing is probably superior. 

All corrections may be made with 
shears and rubber cement. The new matter 
may be placed on top of the old, or else 
the deleted matter may be cut out and the 
new matter pasted in its place. 

Paste pot and shears will also 
serve to make page proofs of galley proofs. 
The paper for the page proof should have a 
strong line running down the middle if the 
final copy is to show the two columns divided by a line. Diagrams, photographs, 
and other non-typescript matter can be fitted into the pages at this stage in the 
preparatory process. 

## V. The Manuscript Book 

Our habits of judgment have been so 
formed that we always expect to see certain 
kinds of thought going around in their

SPECIMEN PAGE OF A SCRIBE BOOK 


For the artistic reproduction of a manuscript an alternative to the 
use of the usual type faces and of typescript presents itself that is as 
intriguing as it is simple. This alternative is the preparation by a trained 
scribe of the copy to be photographically reproduced by the photo-offset or 
photo-gelatine processes. 

The transition from writing to printing only gradually changed the appearance of book pages. The first printers, in fact, strove to make their 
books as nearly like manuscripts as possible. The Blasius copy of the Gutenberg 
Bible is said to have been represented as a manuscript by John Fust and to 
have been sold as such in Paris. The early printers designed type faces 
which imitated the form of letters with which they were familiar. The 
German printers copied the pointed style which later acquired the name 
of gothic and which had been used during the Middle Ages for producing the psalters, missals, breviaries, and the Bibles of the Church. The 
Italian printers developed a face in the humanistic style: a round, neat 
Script coming in with the Renaissance. This style became known as 
roman and reached its greatest perfection under Nicholas Jenson. Only 
gradually were type faces designed which were quite unlike the writing 
of the copyists of the Middle Ages. 

With the mass production of the twentieth century, there has come 
a standardization of type faces which tends to minimize the individuality 
of a book. But with the application of photography to printing the unique quality of the writing of trained scribes can recapture the artistry 
of individual workmanship. The books prepared by scribes possess a 
personality all their own. A conspicuous example of such a book is that produced by Anna Simons, the "Sonetti, Ballate, Sestine" of Dante 
Alighieri in the "Bibliotheca Manu Scripta". The cost of creating such 
books, of course, would vary with the individual scribes.

FIGURE XXXVI 

 {% include pagebreak.html canvas=153 %} working clothes; others we expect to see 
parading in formal dress. Typescript and 
newsprint are the clothes that thought 
wears in its daily work; the typography of 
book manufacture is its more formal attire. 
But the formal dress that thought acquires 
in book typography is only a ready-made 
suit after all: calligraphy offers to 
clothe thought in much richer and more 
beautiful tailor-made attire, which should 
have a higher prestige value than book typography. 

The beauty of the manuscript has 
been increasingly appreciated as the centuries have confirmed the triumph of letterpress. Precisely the same qualities 
that make printing more attractive than 
typescript would tend to make manuscript 
more attractive than printing. There is 
more chance for close adaptation of letter 
form to the spirit of the text, more chance 
for creative artistry. 

The twentieth century has already 
developed its scribes. The influence of 
Edward Johnston, author of the foremost 
general book on illuminating and lettering 
in English,[^n5] has been felt not only in the 
beautification of typographical design but 
also in the growth, especially on the Continent, of a school of artists in whose 
work calligraphy meets creative literature, 
pictorial, art and bookbinding in a product which adapts medieval craft to modern 
design. 

[^n5]: E. Johnston, *Writing and Illuminating* (14th ed., London and New York, 1925). 

The handwritten book, as made by a 
penman like Rudolf Spemann, is, however, a 
rarity; its costs are high and its editions 
small, with the result that the average 
person seldom sees and never possesses a 
manuscript book. 

But now a new prospect opens: the 
manuscript can come back in current publishing; the graphic arts are prepared to 
make it available to the common man. Photo-offset will multiply any black on white for{%- include columnbreak.html canvas=153 col=2 -%}mat copy, whether prepared by relief printing, typewriting or calligraphy. The inexpensive photo-offset press may make possible a production of manuscript books as a 
special small-scale craft; the art of the 
scribe can now return, relieved from the 
rule of constant costs which placed it at 
such a disadvantage in competing with diminishine costs of the printing craft. The 
illustration on the preceding page serves 
to show what might be done in this line. 
(Figure XXXVI.) 

## Cost Analysis: Composition Costs 

The area and running costs of a 
manuscript book reproduced by photo-offset 
do not differ from those of any other kind 
of book reproduced by this technique. The 
difference comes in composition costs, 
which naturally are high as compared with 
those of typescript and linotype work. 
There are no set prices for handwritten 
master copy, but an estimate of 1200 words 
per day at $3.00 or thirty pages a week for 
$20.00 was made for the Joint Committee. 

These prices would naturally be 
prohibitive for the 50,000-word book chosen 
as a standard for the other pages in this 
chapter. They would be reasonable, however, 
for the reproduction of current literature---say, a small volume of poetry. The reproduction of current literature in this form might have an interesting effect upon culture, for it might help to implement cultural decentralization away from the great 
metropolitan centers. It would have little 
bearing, however, upon the problem of reproducing research materials except as it 
would help to deprive book typography of 
its privileged place as an arbiter of intellectual quality.
