{% include pagebreak.html canvas=321 %} In the discussion of the cost levels and possible applications of microcopying in the preceding chapter, allusion 
was made from time to time to specific 
makes of apparatus, either already on the 
market or under development. These must 
now be compared from the standpoint of 
initial cost and working efficiency. The 
microcopying cameras here compared and 
noted are the following: 

Class I. Cameras designed to serve for 
pictorial photography, but 
adapted to use in document copying. 

1. Cinescopie (Belgium). 
2. E.K.A. camera, with Lemare accessories (used by Library of Congress in copying foreign archives). 
3. Leica camera, with Leica accessories (used by many American scholars). 
4. Contax camera, with Zeiss accessories (a later product than Leica, but similar in many respects). 
5. Argus camera, an American camera resembling the Leica (front lens required). 
6. Bantam kodak, an Eastman, quantity production, low-price camera. 

Class II. Cameras designed primarily for document copying. 

1. Ansco Universal copying camera. 
2. Ludwig camera, made to order (used at Yale University Library, New York Public Library). 
3. Filmograph (not on the market as apparatus). 
4. Draeger camera (used at U. S. Bureau of Agriculture for Bibliofilm 
5. service) 
5. Commercial Recordak (used in copying the NRA and AAA records). 
6. Newspaper Recordak (sole installation at Rochester). {% include columnbreak.html canvas=321 col=2 %}
7. Eastman bound—volume copying camera, 16mm. film (in process of development). 
8. Eastman bound—volume copying camera for newspapers, 35mm. film. 
9. Kennedy camera (made to order). 
10. Folmer Graflex photocopying camera (in course of development). 
11. Matson camera (built for Edwards Brothers, Ann Arbor). 

## The Camera and the Use of Film 

These cameras differ greatly in respect of their use of film. One distinction lies between the use of the long and 
short roll. All the cameras of the first 
class take a short roll of film (three to 
ten feet); all the cameras of the second 
class, except the Ansco, take a long roll 
of film (100 feet or more). The Leitz 
Company has made an intermediate camera 
that takes thirty-three feet of film. Advantage lies with the cameras that will 
take rolls of 100 feet or more, because 
film strips of that length can take advantage of low processing costs, due to the 
development of machinery for the motion 
picture industry. 

Another distinction lies between 
the fixed and variable frames. All the 
cameras of the first class have a fixed 
frame size for each exposure; some of the 
cameras in the second class have variable 
frame sizes. The variable frame is an advantage because it permits the more economical adaptation of film to copy. 

Some of the cameras of the second 
class carry the principle of variability 
to the point where they can use either 
16mm. or 35mm. film. The Draeger camera 
can even be adapted to the use of 70mm. 
film, and the Folmer Graflex machine to 
the use of paper. The more variation that 
is possible in the copying machine, the 
more closely film and copy can be adapted 
to each other. 

Two of the cameras, the E.K.A. and {% include pagebreak.html canvas=322 %} the Filmograph, use an unperforated film; 
some of the others use film that is perforated on one side only; others use film 
with perforations on both sides. The unperforated film yields a larger film area 
for the same price as perforated film, but 
misses the economies that can come from 
low processing costs in processing machinery that requires perforations. The film 
perforated on both sides can be adapted to 
use in a larger number of projectors and 
to processing in a larger number of processing machines, but it is least economical 
in the use of the film area. Some large-scale processing machines will not print 
copies from a double-frame negative; they 
will work only with single-frame negatives. 
The machines that use film perforated on 
one side only compromise between the desirability of devoting as little film as 
necessary to perforations, and the need for 
adaptation to moving picture machinery in 
processing. The characteristics of the 
different cameras in this respect are noted on the chart. 

Another camera quality that affects 
the use of film is the optical system. In 
many cases, this is a matter of lens efficiency. The problem has been discussed in 
the chapter above on resolving power. Since 
a lens can often be purchased separately 
from the camera, and the resolving power of 
the lens reaches a maximum with the more 
expensive lenses, the lens might be considered separately from the camera, except for 
those cases in which the two are sold without the possibility of substitution. The 
Recordak cameras differ from all others in 
that they use a slit rather than a full 
lens. 

One feature of the lens or focusing 
system is not unlike the control of film 
areas in its relation to the full use of
film area. This is the ability to vary 
the reduction ratio. Two of the Recordak 
cameras work with a fixed reduction ratio 
and fixed focus. 

A related element of structure in 
the camera is its adaptation to copying 
areas of different size. Some camera equipment, notably the E.K.A. camera with Lemare Ampligraph equipment, does not easily 
lend itself to taking full newspaper pages. 
This is indeed a matter that may be controlled by the mounting of the camera rather than by the camera itself, but the {% include columnbreak.html canvas=322 col=2 %} mounting is an integral part of a well-designed copying equipment. 

## The Camera and the Mechanics of Operation 

These cameras differ in the degree 
to which their operation is automatic, and 
hence in the labor costs of photography to 
which they give rise. 

In general the cameras of the first 
class are the least automatic, and the automatic document copying features appear in 
the cameras of the second class only. 

The features affecting labor costs 
of copying are the following: 

(a) devices for holding copy in place; 
(b) devices for focusing; (c) devices for 
making exposures; (d) devices for moving 
film; (e) devices for controlling relation 
of light to exposure. 

The Recordak cameras can be provided with automatic light control; the 
Draeger and Folmer Graflex cameras have 
automatic focusing; the Ludwig camera has 
no automatic features. Sometimes the automatic features involve hand work, in other 
cases there is a motor attachment. These 
features of automatic operation are designated in the chart. 

Another quality is portability, 
often found inversely related to automatic 
efficiency. 

The complete equipment for microcopying is often made up of so many different parts, or subject to such variations 
in assembly, that the chart above does not 
render a full account of the qualities of 
each machine. The machines are, therefore, 
listed here in order, with more complete 
descriptions. 

## Cinescopie and Photoscopie 

A Belgium company began operations 
in the 1920's, with a catalogue list of 
"Film 'microphote' de la Photoscopie," as 
a cheap but efficient substitute for glass 
slides used in art study and visual education. It issued a catalogue of geographic, 
religious, scientific, and artistic subjects, and sought to interest the historical associations and library associations 
of Europe in its use as a preserver of pictorial and documentary material. The 
Photoscopie has its offices at 121 Rue 
Berkmans, Brussels; a similar enterprise, 
the Cinescopie, is located at 29 Rue aux 
Laines, Brussels. Cinescopie, like {% include pagebreak.html canvas=323 %}

{% include pagebreak.html canvas=324 %} Photoscopie, issues a general catalogue of 
film subjects in all fields. The specifications of the Cinescopie camera are interesting. The machine is small: 9 1/2 
x 4 1/2 x 6cm. The shutter makes automatically measured exposures up to one second, 
which is not sufficient for document copying. The actual film carrier takes a 
length of three meters of standard 35mm. 
film, which means 120 pictures. The film 
must be loaded in the dark. A "holder containing more film is contemplated for those 
who wish to take as many as 500 or more 
views on a single film. The camera can be 
fastened to any photo stand." The projector goes with the camera, can be fastened to a camera stand, and can project 
downward onto a table. The camera is the 
most portable of all; it is the only one 
that can really be carried in the pocket. 

The Cinescopie suffers by comparison with the Leica or Contax camera because 
of the low resolving power of the lens. But 
the lens is satisfactory for making reductions of ten diameters from ordinary book 
type. The frame of exposure, while fixed, 
is smaller than the exposure frame of the 
Leica and Contax cameras, and therefore 
permits the copying of more pages per foot 
of film. The same observation applies to 
the Eastman Kodak Company's "Bantam," 
$10.50 including supplementary lens, and 
the Argus camera, $12.00 without supplementary lens. 

For certain kinds of work, notably 
the copying of whole newspaper pages, the 
Cinescopie, Bantam and Argus would be unsatisfactory because of its low efficiency 
optical system. But in the ordinary copying of books, this is not a disadvantage; 
the purchaser of the Leica or Contax cameras should be warned that he is buying 
photographic power that the fixed frame of 
the film will not permit him to use anyway 
in the copying of book pages of average 
typography and size. A principal disadvantage of the Cinescopie as an aid to the 
American scholar is the absence of a commercial organization in America to take 
care of sales. The Bantam and Argus have 
sales organization, but no equipment to 
adapt to document copying. 

## The E.K.A. Camera and Lemare Ampligraph 

The camera used by the Library of 
Congress in copying foreign documents from {% include columnbreak.html canvas=324 col=2 %} the archives was of French make, an E.K.A. 
camera manufactured by Krause of Paris, 
with accessories manufactured by Paul Lemare, 73 Rue Fondary, Paris, XVI. 

In 1930 the E.K.A. camera and stand 
were quoted at 3,250 francs, and the manuscript box at 511 francs, the lights at 3500 
francs, not including cost of packing and 
shipping. 

The camera uses a sixteen and one-half foot length of unperforated 35mm. 
film, taking 100 exposures on a loading. It 
must be loaded in the dark. The dimensions 
of the exposure frame are the largest of 
any used in microcopying: 30mm. x 45mm. 
This use of unperforated film lowers the 
cost per square foot of photosensitive surfact, but the large exposure frame cancels 
some of this advantage by using more surface than would be necessary with a maximum 
reduction ratio. The unperforated film limits processing possibilities also. While 
the E.K.A. camera is theoretically perfectly adapted to the copying of newspapers, 
the Ampligraph stand that Lemare makes for 
it does not give sufficient height or area 
for this work. 

## Leica and Contax Equipment 

The most widely used camera for 
document copying is neither the Belgian 
Cinescopie nor the French E.K.A., but the 
German Leica. It is a multiple purpose 
camera, a piece of precision mechanism, for 
which innumerable attachments and accessories are available. Experiments in newspaper copying with the Leica were made with 
this camera in 1926 at the Hoover War Library at Stanford University; the camera 
used by Dr. Bendikson for microcopying at 
the Huntington Library at San Marino, California, is the Leica; Professor Krisopp 
Lake of Harvard University has used a 
Leica extensively in photographing manuscripts in the Near Hast; Professor James 
A. Barnes at Temple University is another 
pioneer. The equipment has become almost 
a standard implement in research work. 

After the Leica camera had made a 
market, the Zeiss Contax camera appeared 
as a competitor. It resembles the Leica 
in its precision and its long catalogue of 
accessories. These catalogues are so extensive that the scholar may well ask for 
a Baedeker to guide him through them. The 
following paragraphs are written as an {% include pagebreak.html canvas=325 %}

FIGURE LXVI 

Leica camera, projector, and accessory lenses 

{% include columnbreak.html canvas=325 col=1 %} attempt at such a guide, with equipment 
designated by number and code word. The 
differences between the Zeiss and the Leica 
equipment are not significant in respect 
of adaptation to document copying. Both 
cameras used a five-foot roll of 35mm. 
film perforated on both sides. Both have 
loading magazines which can be loaded with 
film in the dark and inserted in the camera by daylight. Neither will serve as a 
document copying camera until it has been 
supplemented with certain accessories. {% include columnbreak.html canvas=325 col=2 %}

### (a) The Lens and Camera 

The earlier models of the Leica, 
notably Models A and B, did not have detachable lens mounts. They are no longer 
advertised in the catalogues, and are 
available mostly in the second-hand market 
at a price of about $40.00. The normal 
equipment for both cameras is a 50mm. 
f 3.5 lens; the Leica lens goes under the 
trade name of *Elmar*, the Contax under the 
trade name *Tessar*. This standard lens, 
sold separately from the camera, is priced: 

| Leitz Elmar 50mm. f 3.5 | $49.50 (50,320 ELMAR) |
| Contax Zeiss Tessar 50mm. £.35.5 | 49.50 |

The cameras, with these lenses, are priced as follows: 

| Leica Model D (50,030 LYKAN) | $81.00 (without lens); $130.50 with lens. Models F and G are higher priced, but the increased price pays for qualities that are of no value in document photography. |
| Contax Model I | $130.50 with lens. |

{% include pagebreak.html canvas=326 %} The Leica Model FF with magazine holding 
thirty-three feet of film sells for $195.00 
without lens, or $244.50 with lens. 

In order to equip these cameras for 
document photography, it is necessary either to have a supplementary lens that 
will focus at the necessary short distances, or to have an attachment that will remove the regular lens to a greater than 
normal distance from the camera. 

The supplementary lenses are sold 
at the following prices: 

| Leitz Front Lens, No. 1 (minimum area covered in copying, 8" x 12"; 57,730 ELPRO) | $6.30 | 
| Leitz Front Lens, No. 2 (minimum area covered in copying, 5" x 8"; 57.750 ELPIK) | $7.20 | 

Contax (Zeiss) Proxar supplementary lenses, corresponding to 
the above Leitz supplementary lenses, are listed but not priced 
in the catalogue material. 

The Contax catalogue also refers 
to three Delta lenses, which are sold at 
$7.50 the set (#5520); these seem to correspond to the Leica front lenses in copying work. 

With these supplementary lenses, 
the camera can be brought near enough to a 
page to make the page fill the whole frame 
of the film. The reduction ratio involved 
in the use of Front Lens No. 1 in copying 
a normal spread of two book pages with the 
Leica is a little more than eight diameters. In copying ordinary books, this reduction ratio, or something near it, is 
the only one that is possible because of 
the fixed frame size of the exposure area 
on the film. It must be noted that much 
of the high optical quality of the Leica 
and Contax cameras and lenses goes to waste 
in copying ordinary books because of the 
large fixed frame of the film, which does 
not suit reductions of ordinary pages to 
the high ratios that the resolving power 
of lens and film would otherwise make possible. 

The alternative to the use of front 
lens equipment is the use of an extension 
tube, which is screwed into the lens mount. 
The extension tube, by increasing the distance between lens and film, makes it possible to bring the camera nearer to the 
object that is being copied, and hence to 
cover the full frame of the film with the 
image of a smaller object than the normal 
mechanics of the camera would permit. If {% include columnbreak.html canvas=326 col=2 %} the extension tube is used, however, the 
photographer must have a special device 
for checking the accuracy of his focusing. 
When the front lens is used, he can measure the distance from camera to object and 
focus the lens on a calibrated scale; when 
an extension tube is used, he must be able 
to focus directly on ground class. There 
is no technical reason for this, for the 
Leitz Company might prepare scales that 
would permit measured focusing with each 
of the extension tubes. But in the absence of such scales, the use of the extension tube is tied with the use of "sliding focusing copying attachment," Model I 
or Model II. 

The sliding focusing copying attachment is a device in which the lens is 
mounted in a holder that carries a ground 
glass at exactly the film distance from the 
lens. The camera, loaded with film, can 
be slipped away from the lens without 
spoiling the film; the focus can then be 
adjusted by watching the ground glass. 

Then the camera can be slipped back into 
place and the picture taken. The difference between Model I (57,600 FULDY), which 
sells for $24.75, and Model II (57,610 
FULET), which sells for $13.50, is that 
the more expensive model lets the camera 
slide back and forth in front of the lens 
in grooves, while the Model II makes it 
necessary for the operator to remove the 
camera and lay it down on the table while 
focusing on the ground glass. 

The Contax camera uses another device to secure the same result, for the 
Contax, unlike the Leica, has a removable 
back. The camera is unloaded, a piece of 
ground glass fitted in the place of the 
film, the focusing adjusted, and the camera 
reloaded. The ground glass focusing system 
of the Contax is much less convenient than 
that of the Leica because of the necessity 
of unloading the camera for each focusing 
operation. The ground glass focusing 
screen sells for $4.50 (#5520). 

{% include pagebreak.html canvas=327 %} With the camera adapted for ground 
glass focusing, the extension tube principle can be applied. The Leica extension 
tubes are priced as follows: 

| 57,635 (FUROR), 1.2cm. extenston tube | $1.80 |
| 57,640 (UBECD), 2.2cm. extension tube | 1.80 |

Either of these extension tubes 
will be sufficient for all ordinary document copying, but a tube that will permit 
the photographing of even smaller areas is 
the 3cm. tube, which sells for $2.10. 

A study of the Zeiss catalogue 
does not show any attachment corresponding 
exactly to the Leitz extension tubes. Apparently the Delta lenses take the place 
of extension tube equipment. Therefore, 
the inconvenience of ground glass focusing 
with the Contax can be avoided, since the 
camera with the front lenses can be brought 
into focus at measured distances over measured areas by consulting a table. 

To summarize: in order to adapt 
the camera for document copying, the photographer needs as a minimum, (a) Leica: 
either front lens ($6.50), or extension 
tube and sliding focusing copying attachment ($1.20 plus $13.50; total, $14.50); 
(b) Contax: three Delta lenses ($7.50). 

The camera is now adapted to document copying from the optical standpoint. 
It remains to prepare a stand that will 
hold it in position. Here again a number 
of alternatives present themselves, but 
the minimal equipment is a sliding arm 
that will hold the camera and slide up and 
down on a rod. 

The Leica sliding arm (57,620 
VEARM) sells for $10.50; the corresponding 
Contax item is called a "reproduction bracket" (#995/32) and is priced at $27.00. The 
Contax bracket includes an attachment that 
is very useful, namely, a steel tape attached to the bracket to make measurement 
of distance from camera to baseboard a 
simple operation. Note that the greater 
convenience in measured distance focusing 
with the Contax bracket contrasts to the {% include columnbreak.html canvas=327 col=2 %} 
greater convenience in ground glass focus-— 
ing with the Leica attachments. 

The photographer now has his camera fixed to a bracket, but the bracket 
must be mounted on an upright rod, and the 
upright rod, attached to some kind of a 
base before he can begin work. The Leitz 
Company sells for $103.50 a "universal reproduction device" of basic equipment, 
which consists of baseboard, upright pillar, sliding arm, and steel tape measure. 
This equipment includes a special type of 
sliding arm that is especially convenient 
in using the ground glass focusing attachment. But the essentials are the pillar 
and the baseboard. Bought separately, the 
collapsible upright pillar (57,524 ZSLOO) 
costs $31.50, the baseboard (VAFOO) has no 
separate price listed in the catalogue. 
The combination pillar and baseboard in 
the Contax catalogue is listed at $12.00 
(#1454/28). 

The Leitz Company also offers a 
highly portable apparatus that will serve 
for taking ordinary book pictures, the name 
is "collapsible table reproduction device" 
(57,679 OOZIS), and it costs $35.00. There 
should be a quotation for a non-collapsible 
upright pillar in the 1935 Leica catalogue 
but the writer does not find it; in 1933 ;
the 100cm. metal pillar was quoted at $8.00 
(35,463 VERYN). 

But the photographer can take leave 
of the catalogue and its prices when he has 
the sliding arm or bracket, for the baseboard is nothing but a board, and the pillar nothing but a column which can be made 
from any ordinary steel tubing, fitted to 
a flange and screwed to a board base. The 
writer made one for $1.50, and many scholars have built the mountings for their 
Leica cameras in various designs. 

To summarize, the following minimum investment is required in setting up 
Leica or Contax document copying equipment: 

| Leica: | Camera and lens | $130.50 | |
| | Optical adaptation for document copying | 6.50 | (or $14.70) |
| | Sliding arm | 10.50 | |
| | Pillar and baseboard (home manufacture) | 1.50 | |
| | | $149.00 | |

{% include pagebreak.html canvas=328 %} 

| Contax: | Camera and lens | $130.50 | |
| | Optical adaptation | 7.50 | |
| | Sliding bracket | 27.00 | |
| | Pillar and baseboard (home manufacture) | 1.50 | |
| | | $166.50 | |

It remains to set up the lighting 
system. The lighting fixtures included in 
the Leica and Contax catalogues are not 
photographically superior to those that can 
be rigged from materials purchasable at the 
hardware store. Ordinary lighting fixtures 
with electric cords and plugs provide the 
source of illumination, and a system of reflectors must be used. 

The account here made of the lighting problem is applicable to any installation. If it is desired to hold down the 
pages that are to be copied by means of a 
glass plate laid on them, the lights must 
be set far enough to the side so that they 
do not reflect from the glass into the lens. 
This side illumination requires more light 
than vertical illumination. Most ordinary 
lighting fixtures concentrate the light in 
spots; to distribute it evenly over the 
material to be copied is a principal objective of the photographer. This can be 
done by using reflectors with non-parabolic 
curves, and by diffusing the light through 
semi-transparent tissues such as tracing 
cloth or lens paper. The diffusion screen 
absorbs a large amount of light, and, 
therefore, makes necessary higher power 
lights or longer exposure time than would 
otherwise be called for. 

The purchaser of photographic 
equipment will find opportunity in the Leica 
or Contax catalogue to invest a small fortune, but the minimum essentials are those 
set forth above. 

## The Argus 

A camera and projector combination 
that deserves close watching is the Argus, 
manufactured by the International Radio 
Corporation of Ann Arbor Michigan. The 
camera resembles the Leica in many respects, but sells for $12.50. At the time 
of writing the tests of the camera for 
document copying had not been made, but the 
manufacturers are considering an adaptation 
to document copying. There is also a projector, that is priced at $25.00, and this 
may be developed by means of supplementary {% include columnbreak.html canvas=328 col=2 %} attachments into a reading machine.

The Argus camera will never develop 
the automatic features proposed in the 
Draeger or the Folmer Graflex; it probably 
will not attain the optical efficiency of 
the Leica or Contax. But it may well turn 
out to be the American substitute for Leica 
and Contax, for it is going on the market 
at the low prices that quantity production 
permits. 

## Ansco Universal Still-Film Copying Camera 

The cheapest of the many cameras 
designed specifically for document copying 
is the Ansco Universal Still-Film copying 
camera, which sells for $50.00 including 
camera mount. The lens is mounted on a 
frame facing a vertical copy board which 
can be clamped in position at any distance 
up to three feet from the lens. The copy 
board will hold a sheet 11" x 14", which 
is the largest size that can be photographed conveniently with this apparatus. 
The frame of film exposed is just half the 
size of the Leica or Contax area; it is a 
single frame camera, whereas the Leica and 
Contax are double frame cameras. This 
smaller area of film should call for higher optical efficiency in the lens, but in 
fact the lens system is much less efficient. 
Nevertheless, two pages of a book in large 
print, or one page of a book in small print, 
can be copied with this camera. 

The focusing is done in a way that 
suggests the sliding focusing copying attachment of the Leica camera. The lens is 
fastened to a board, behind which two chambers can be moved. One chamber contains 
the film, the other is backed with ground 
glass. The chamber with the ground glass 
is placed behind the lens, and the copy is 
brought into focus. Then the film chamber 
is moved behind the lens and the film exposed. There is no shutter on the lens. 
The exposure is made by removing a lens 
cap. 

The principal deficiencies of the 
apparatus, apart from the low quality of 
the lens, are the absence of any device to {% include  pagebreak.html canvas=329 %} let the photographer know when he has used 
up his roll of film and the vertical position of the copy stand. The film loadings are very short--only three feet. A 
loading is fitted into a small wooden box, 
the box slipped into place in the film 
chamber, and a piece of the film drawn over 
some sprocket wheels. It is difficult 
but not impossible to reload the film magazine from a long roll of raw film. The 
film loadings, including the wooden magazine, are sold by the Ansco Company for 
$.50; they contain only $.06 worth of film. 
The film is moved by a downward pressure of 
the hand over the sprocket wheels. But 
there is no signal to let the operator 
know when he has used up his three feet of 
film. 

Moreover, the holding of copy is 
very difficult. A book refuses to stand 
up with flat open pages, and even separate 
documents are not easily clamped in place. 
There are some good ideas in the design, 
but the equipment is certainly not suited 
to the needs of anyone who has more than an 
occasional document to copy. 

## The Ludwig Camera 

The photographer of Yale University 
Library, Mr. Frederick Ludwig, has designed 
a camera based on the lens system and frame 
size of the Leica, but capable of holding 
a longer roll of film. His apparatus is a 
wooden camera, with a detachable lens, and 
a unique focusing system. The wide aperture of the 50mm. f 3.5 lens admits so 
much light that the ordinary process film 
acts like a piece of ground glass in focusing. There is a tube through which the 
operator can look at the back of the film 
while focusing. The frame used for this 
purpose is spoiled, but the convenience of 
focusing is so great that the loss of material can be ignored. The film is turned 
by hand; the exposure can be made with a 
shutter mount or by removing a lens cap 
from the lens. The focusing is quickly 
done, but it is often not accurate enough 
to take full advantage of the efficiency 
of the lens. This makes little difference 
in copying ordinary book pages, because the 
large frame size of the camera exposure 
calls only for reductions of the range of 
ten diameters. 

Mr. Ludwig has built a number of 
these cameras to order. They are the {% include columnbreak.html canvas=329 col=2 %} least expensive of the document cameras 
that take the 100 foot roll of film ($50.00 
for the camera without the lens; $15.00 
for the stand and bracket). 

One of these cameras is installed 
in the New York Public Library, another was 
bought by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace for copying Peace Conference 
documents, another is in use in Spain for 
copying documents that are studied at New 
Haven by Professor Rose of the Yale faculty.

## The Matson Camera 

Edwards Brothers of Ann Arbor arranged for the construction of a special 
document copying camera. Their designer, 
Mr. Robert Matson, started with a motion 
picture camera and adapted it to document 
photography. It has the smaller frame of 
exposure, thus permitting higher reduction 
ratios in book copying. It also has some 
automatic features, notably a foot pedal 
that makes the exposure and turns the film. 

Consumers Research, Inc., made another document copying camera from a mo- 
tion picture camera. Cameras adapted from 
motion picture apparatus start with the 
smaller frame size, the longer roll of film, 
and the rudiments of an automatic exposure 
system. In this respect, they are more 
promising than the Leica as the basic design for a document copying camera. 

## The Filmograph and Kennedy Cameras 

Mr. H. C. Lambach of Seattle and 
Mr. Lloyd B. Kennedy of Warren, Ohio entered upon microcopying as a means of setting up the records of title abstract companies. They worked independently of each 
other into this field in the 1920's and 
1930's, and each designed his own microcopying apparatus. In both cases, the 
automatic principle was carried forward to 
a high degree of perfection. 

The Kennedy camera takes a long 
roll of film---1000 feet---but, of course, 
any part of it can be cut off and developed when exposed. The shutter and ratchet to turn the film are operated by a motor. The ratchet can be set to move the 
film any chosen distance for each exposure, 
and windows of varying sizes can be fitted 
in front of the film to vary the area of 
exposure. A variable frame necessitates 
the use of a lens large enough to cover {% include pagebreak.html canvas=330 %} the largest frame, hence a loss in resolving power. Hither perforated or unperforated film can be used. In building a new 
camera, Mr. Kennedy would equip it to take 
either 16mm. or 35mm. film. 

The lighting system is wired to a 
rheostat and voltmeter to stabilize the 
light intensity. In focusing, Mr. Kennedy 
makes a test strip to find the best chemical (as distinguished from visible or optical) focus, and then hooks his lens 
mount in the correct position. The focusing is more accurate but also more troublesome than with the Ludwig or Leica cameras. 

The most interesting part of the 
Kennedy machine is the automatic device by 
which the exposure is made and the film 
turned by pressing a glass plate down on 
the page to be copied. An electric circuit, made and broken by contacts on the 
wooden frame that holds the glass, opens 
and closes the shutter, moves the film, 
and then rings a bell to tell the operator 
that the exposure is made and he can turn 
another page. 

Mr. Kennedy counts on a speed of 
5,000 exposures (10,000 pages) per day. He 
will manufacture this machine to order for 
a price somewhere near $300.00 and design 
into it such features as the purchaser may 
desire. The Filmograph equipment is not 
on the market. 

## The Draeger Camera 

The Filmograph and Kennedy cameras 
were designed for use in copying title documents for abstract companies; the Draeger 
camera was designed for copying library 
material and research documents. 

The Draeger camera is used in the 
Bibliofilm Service of the Library of the 
Department of Agriculture, and is installed 
in the Library of Congress. It takes 16m. 
and 65mm. film, and can use a special 7Omm. 
magazine. The lens is £:6.3; the frame of 
the film is variable, ranging from 1/2" to 
1 1/2" along the length of the film; the 
film roll is 500 or 1000 feet; the operation is entirely automatic, only the turning of the book pages being required of 
the operator. 

There is a prospect that the camera will be manufactured to order for libraries that intend to use it for developing a microcopying service. Dr. Draeger {% include columnbreak.html canvas=330 col=2 %} 

FIGURE LXVII 

Draeger camera (early model) 

is interested in developing the design of 
the camera to meet the needs of scholars. 

## The Folmer Graflex Camera 

Mr. Edson S. Hineline, engineer 
of the Folmer Graflex Corporation, is working out a camera which will have extraordinary utility. The camera, now in the 
course of development, is expected to take, 
through interchangeable magazines, any one 
of four types of sensitized material: 
strips of paper 7Omm. wide; 35mm. double-perforated film; 16mm. film perforated on one side; and 70mm. film with double perforation. The Factograph paper and the 
film strips will be loaded in 100-foot 
lengths. The possibility is anticipated 
of either loading film purchased in bulk 
in a dark room, or of loading specially 
prepared rolls of film in daylight. 

With the 35mm. film, it will be 
possible to make not only the conventional 
double frame full-size exposure, but a single frame exposure one-half the customary 
size. This will permit conforming to the 
principle of maximum utilization of area 
without sacrificing simplicity and uniformity in projection and reading. 

The camera will be provided with a {% include pagebreak.html canvas=331 %}

FIGURE LXVIII

New Folmer Graflex Camera 

{% include pagebreak.html canvas=332 %}

{% include pagebreak.html canvas=333 %} self-supporting stand, consisting of a 
sturdy separable upright column attached 
to the base. When the base is closed, it 
becomes the case for carrying the camera 
and its accessories. The case will be approximately 11" x 17" x 6". 

The illumination will be provided 
by photo flood lamps supported from the 
main column in such a manner as to permit 
movement and adjustment to any conceivable 
location. The photo flood lamps will be 
connected with the resistor, which provides reduced intensity in the illumination except during the brief interval required for the exposure. This will not only prolong the life of the lamp, but will 
reduce possibility of eyestrain on the 
part of the operator. 

The shutter can be set to predetermined exposure time within a broad 
range. The entire operation of the outfit 
after placing the book in proper position 
will be automatically governed by air pressure emanating from a foot treadle which 
will turn on the lights to full photo flood 
intensity, advance the film, and make the 
exposure of pre-determined duration. This 
will leave both hands free for the manipulation of the materials to be copied. A 
book cradle, which will be available as an 
accessory, will serve to keep the materials to be copied in the plane of focus 
through upward pressure against a plate 
glass. 

The value of the machine as a device for copying documents and books results from the fact that it is designed 
for this specific purpose, and does not 
sacrifice this purpose to others, such as 
landscapes and art photography. Just as 
a Leica camera will do a great many things 
in pictorial photography, but only a few 
in document photography, so this camera 
has a marvelous elasticity in meeting the 
problems of reproducing research materials, 
but will not do landscape or art work. 

If the scholar wants the cheapest 
possible paper copies, he can get them directly by loading the camera with Factograph paper (not indirectly, as in the 
Leica system, by photographing on film and 
enlarging). If he has a series of short 
items to be copied and filed separately, 
he can take them on paper or film cut into short lengths. If he has a long series 
to copy, he can take it on long rolls, {% include columnbreak.html canvas=333 col=2 %} like those that are made with the Recordak 
machine. 

The development of this machine 
will be watched with special interest by 
scholars, because this camera is being designed for prospective quantity production 
and sales at a price that will attract individual buyers. The other automatic cameras are being developed more for the use 
of libraries with microcopying services. 
The price of this camera cannot be announced as yet, and the design is not finally established. It is hoped, however, that 
it will be adaptable to copying for any projection equipment, that the price will be 
something near the level of a typewriter, 
and that it may become for the next generation of scholars as indispensable as the 
typewriter. 

## The Recordak Bound-Book Copying Camera 

The Eastman Kodak Company is developing a camera for copying bound materials. 
While it is still in an unfinished stage, 
some details of the new camera are known. 
The camera will be movable but, to quote 
Eastman, "it would hardly be called portable." There are two models, one for 16mm. 
film and another for 35mm. film. This film 
will be taken in 100-foot rolls. The lens 
used will be an Anastigmatic one with f:4.5 
opening. Books up to 12" x 16" and up to 
5" thick can be copied. The machine is designed to be almost entirely automatic. It 
will be motor driven and a touch of a button will automatically bring down the glass 
cover, insuring the material to be copied 
being under the focal plane. The same 
touch will light the lights for illumination, make the exposure, advance the exact 
amount of film required for the next exposure, and finally raise the glass cover so 
that the book is free for the next page to 
be turned. An automatic device will take 
care of raising the book to compensate for 
the decreasing thickness of the book as 
pages are turned. 

For setting up the machine to copy 
a book, a light is projected through the 
film aperture onto the book, throwing a 
square or oblong form of light onto the 
page to show exactly how much of the page 
is being covered at that particular degree 
of reduction and setting the aperture diaphragm. The camera is then raised or lowered so that the width of this light {% include pagebreak.html canvas=334 %} 

FIGURE LXIX

Recordak copying camera

exactly takes in the width of the printed
matter to be copied. When this is set,
the diaphragm of the aperture is adjusted
so that the length of light fits the
length of the material. This setting of
the aperture diaphragm automatically sets
the advancing mechanism of the film, so
that just the right amount of the film to cover this space is advanced after every exposure is made.

## The Recordak Camera

The original development of the
Recordak equipment was in the field of microcopying unbound documents. The machine
was first designed for use in banks in the
copying of checks; then its use was extended to the copying of other documents,
such as charge slips in department stores.
The first large-scale use of it for scholarly purposes was the copying of the AAA
and NRA hearings.

The machine is about the size of a
small typewriter desk. It is foolproof,
not only in operation, but also in processing, for the Recordak Corporation combines
the sale of its processing service with
the sale of film. The loose sheets are {% include columnbreak.html canvas=334 col=2 %} fed into a roller, which carries them
through the photographic field. They are
photographed while in motion, the light reflected from the paper passing through a
slit to a moving roll of film.

The Recordak machines are fixed
focus machines. One model is set to make
reductions of (sixteen diameters, another
of seventeen, a third of eighteen and one-half, and the highest of twenty-three diameters. The twenty-three diameter reduction is satisfactory for good typescript
copy, but not for six-point type.

The machines are leased, not sold.
The lease price is $35.00 a month for a
year's rental, $50.00 for shorter periods.
The processing price and the price of convenient reels and boxes for film storage
are included in the price of the film---$5.50 for a 200-foot roll. These models
all use 16mm. film perforated on one side.

## The Newspaper Recordak

The newspaper Recordak machine is
simply a machine of similar design to the
commercial Recordak which will take a larger Sheet of paper on its roller and photograph it on 35mm. film. The reduction ratio is sixteen diameters. Only unbound
newspapers can be photographed. The newspaper Recordak is not available for use
except at Rochester, consequently the
files of newspapers are shipped to Rochester for copying. If the scale of business
should warrant it, the machine could probably be supplied to institutions for lease
or purchase.

## Projector Reading Machines

In Chapter XI, the problem of the
design of the projector was analyzed for
its bearing on reduction ratio and standardization. In this chapter, the approach
will be somewhat different. Each make of
projector will be examined from the standpoint of reading convenience, and the optimal quality of each will be regarded as only one of a number of important qualities.

The projector is related to the
microcopy in three ways: first, it must
enlarge the microcopy to legible size; second, it must conform mechanically to the
width and perforation of film; third, it
must adapt itself to the length of the film
roll.

There are three families of {% include pagebreak.html canvas=335 %}

FIGURE LXX 

Recordak Projector 

{% include pagebreak.html canvas=336 %}

{% include pagebreak.html canvas=337 %}

projectors. The first consists of those 
that are essentially of the "magic lantern" type, intended for displaying pictures on a screen, and that are adaptable 
to the reading of films. The most important of these are the products of the 
Spencer Lens Company (the Delineascope), 
the Bausch and Lomb Company (the Balopticon), and the E. Leitz Company. All of 
them throw the image against a screen, 
from which the reader reads by reflected 
light. None of them offers high convenience in loading the film or in moving it 
from page to page while reading. Mr. 
Lloyd B. Kennedy has a reading machine 
that reflects the image from two mirrors 
successively, thus bringing it close to 
the reader's eye. 

The second family is the reading 
machine type, developed for the specific 
purpose of reading film. All of these machines meet in one way or another the special problem of loading the film for reading. They fall into two main classes: 
those that project the image on a ground 
glass screen, so that the reader is confronted with transmitted light; and those 
that project on a reflecting screen, so 
that the reader encounters reflected 
light. The writer's experiments, and the 
observations of others, have induced a belief that the transmitted light is more 
fatiguing than the reflected light. According to Mr. Verneur Pratt of International Filmbook Corporation, this generalization is not true, but is the result of 
the use of the wrong translucent screens. 

The third family of combination is 
the combination camera and projector. 

Another type of combination is 
found in the union of an enlarging with a 
projecting device. A projector that throws 
a right image through a translucent screen 
will not serve for an enlarger, because 
sensitive paper laid on such a screen will 
develop a mirror image. The projectors 
that throw the image on a screen for reflection to the eye can be converted into 
enlargers by excluding all light from the 
screen except the light that comes through 
the lens. 

The chart of projectors shows the 
qualities of each in these respects, as 
well as their optical qualities and film 
adaptability. 

The development of the reading ma{%- include columnbreak.html canvas=337 col=2 -%}chines is moving so rapidly that anything 
written at this moment will probably be out 
of date in a few months. The prospective 
purchaser of equipment should make inquiries of the following firms before making a 
decision:

With the reservation that all information here given should be checked 
against the developments of the next few 
months, there are a number of points of 
practical comparison between the different 
makes of projectors now being designed or 
manufactured. 

The best established projectors 
are those of the magic lantern type, for 
their manufacture has been launched for 
other purposes than reading. All of them 
have the weakness that they are primarily 
adapted to a longer distance projecting 
than is convenient in reading. The Bausch 
and Lomb Balopticon and the Spencer Lens 
Delineascope take perforated film; the 
Leica projectors take unperforated. The 
Balopticon and Delineascope are more easily loaded than the Leica, for they receive 
the film from the side, while the Leica receives it from the end. 

Neither the Balopticon nor the Delineascope is equipped with lenses that 
equal the 50mm. f:3.5 Leica camera lens, 
which can be mounted on a Leica projector. 
If a film copy of a newspaper page reduced {% include pagebreak.html canvas=338 %} eighteen diameters is projected on a 
screen, only about one-third of one-half of 
the area will be delineated clearly. If 
the center is brought into focus, the edges will blur; if the text at the edge is 
brought into focus, the center will blur. 
Since the entire page area is illuminated, 
but only a part of it brought into focus, 
there is a certain wastage of light. 

The first of the specialized reading machines were those developed by Filmograph and Kennedy. Filmograph worked out 
a method of mounting projectors of the 
magic lantern type several feet above the 
heads of the readers and controlling the 
movement of the film by means of a long 
belt. This device must have meant difficulty in loading. Kennedy set the projector near the reader's hand and then placed 
a mirror about three feet from the projector to reflect the image back to a second 
mirror and thence to a screen. Both the 
devices thus got the necessary distance 
for projection. 

The first of the Recordak reading 
machines used the principle of the mirror 
and ground glass, resembling in this respect the Kennedy apparatus. Later they 
were shifted to the principle that had 
been used in the Filmograph---the image was 
projected downward on a reflecting surface 
---and the movement of the film strip in 
front of the lens was controlled by a wheel 
set conveniently near the right hand of 
the reader. 

The design of the International 
Filmbook apparatus is still undetermined in 
many respects. Its primary quality at the 
moment is a device for foolproof loading 
from a special cartridge, and a provision 
for the movement of the film to avoid abrasion. It will use the translucent screen 
for a reading surface. 

Because Kennedy and Filmograph were 
exposing a large area of film, i.e., had a 
large aperture, they needed a long distance 
to get their projected image in focus. The 
Recordak, with a film area only about 16mm. 
x 20mm., could use a cheaper lens, shorter 
distance, and less light with the same result in legibility. The International 
Filmbook equipment seems to be carrying the 
principle of small aperture further than 
it is carried by the Recordak. 

When the newspaper Recordak was 
developed, to read a newspaper page 18" x {% include columnbreak.html canvas=338 col=2 %} 22" on a double frame of 35mm. film, the 
problem of projection resembled that which 
Kennedy and Filmograph had met by providing a long distance between lens and screen. 
The Recordak technicians met this problem 
ingeniously by retaining substantially the 
same optical system that had been worked 
out for the small Recordak, and exposing 
only one-fourth of the newspaper filmslide 
to the light. Since the reader cannot 
cover with his eye at a reading distance 
more than one-fourth of a newsprint page, 
it was a happy idea to project only a part 
of the full page at a time. A lever within easy range of the left hand moves the 
film in front of the lens, thus bringing 
the different parts of the page successively into view. 

A problem in all projectors is the 
ability to turn the film through ninety degrees, or to manage in some way to read 
microcopies which have lines running across 
the film strip and also those with lines 
running parallel to the film strip. Dr. 
Draeger has been most successful in solving 
this problem. The Recordak library projector has hardly met it at all. The International Filmbook Corporation has given it 
full attention. In the projectors of the 
magic lantern type, this problem is easily 
met by turning the film holder through 
ninety degrees. 

Another unsolved problem in projector reading machines is that of shifting 
from small aperture-high enlargement to 
large aperture-low enlargement by changing 
lenses and condensers. Of course, a projector of the magic lantern type will give 
enlargements in any required degree, but 
only at the sacrifice of intensity of illumination. A projector to meet all purposes would be one which could be fitted 
with a lens and condenser that would magnify a double frame 35mm. film by ten diameters, and then by some simple shift could 
be changed to magnify a single frame 16mm. 
film by twenty-five diameters. Such a projector would read any microcopies now being made. The International Filmbook Projector is to have a turret of three lenses, 
and a slide with two condensers, to serve 
this variability.

The Recordak, and presumably the 
International Filmbook, Draeger, and Folmer 
Graflex projectors, will be provided with {% include pagebreak.html canvas=339 %}

{% include pagebreak.html canvas=343 %}

either 16mm. or 35mm. film; but none of 
them will permit a shift in aperture and 
enlargement ratio. 

Another key problem in the design 
of projectors is the ease of loading and 
place finding. The tendency of design in 
place. finding---which is important for long 
runs---is to introduce some kind of calibration which permits the reader to turn 
quickly to the desired place in the roll of 
film. The corresponding requirement for 
short runs is ease and rapidity of loading. 
The best apparatus from this standpoint 
would be one which could be loaded, either 
with a reel or a short strip of film, from 
the sitting reading position, without 
stretching the arm upward or outward. If 
loading could be made as easy as turning 
the pages of a book, the use of short-run 
film copies would be greatly facilitated. 

While these observations are in 
some respect inconclusive, they do support 
the conclusion that the problems of design 
in reading machines are rapidly finding solution.

## Projector—and-Enlargement Equipment 

The combination of projector reading with enlarging machinery has already 
been noted as a possibility, and the possible development of low cost levels in {% include columnbreak.html canvas=343 col=2 %} making enlargements on paper from film has 
been mentioned. Dr. Draeger is designing 
an automatic enlarger that should give 
speeds of 5,000 to 10,000 pages a day. The 
essentials of such an enlarger are merely 
the automatic stepping of the film in front 
of the lens, the automatic control of light 
and exposure time, and efficient devices 
for paper holding. 

Dr. Vernon D. Tate, of the National 
Archives, is working out another important 
part of the program of microcopying development. He is interested in the standardizing of instructions covering light intensities, exposure times, and processing. The 
conditions under which document copying 
takes place are subject. to a far higher degree of standardization than those under 
which pictorial photography is carried on. 
The object photographed is a black and 
white, the light is usually artificial, 
and the range of distances and reduction 
ratios is small as compared with those encountered in general photographic practices. The emphasis in the technique is definitely placed on fineness of grain and 
high contrast. If the average research 
worker can be trained to be his own photographer, and to make enlargements from 
his own microcopy films, the resulting release from burdensome mechanical work in 
the collecting and organizing of material 
should have a marked effect on intellectual standards in research. {% include pagebreak.html canvas=344 %}
