 {% include pagebreak.html canvas=265 %} There is a final limit beyond 
which the principle of reducing the size 
of the reading matter cannot be carried. 
This limit is reached in "filmslide" or 
microcopying. The name "filmslide" or 
"filmstat" has come to be applied to a 
process of copying on film and reading by 
projection. The word "microcopying" would 
be more appropriate if glass should come 
in as a photographic material. 

## Resolving Power of Emulsion 

The technological limit of reduction of print is fixed by by the size of the 
grain on a photographic emulsion.[^n1] The 
dark portions of a photograph are made up 
of clots of small particles of metallic 
silver embedded in dry gelatin. The relation between the size of these grains and 
the possible extent of photographic reduction of reading matter can be graphically 
illustrated if one imagines that he has 
before him a level table top and a few 
handfuls of sand, and wants to form letters on the table top by laying down lines 
of loose sand. If the sand is very fine-grained, like powder, he will be able to 
make smaller letters than if the sand is 
coarse-grained or gravelly. But no matter 
how fine the sand there will be a limit, a 
size of letter, in which the grains from 
the different strokes of the writing will 
run together, the hollows inside the "d's" 
and the "e's" fill up. Letters the size 
of these printed on this page could not be {% include columnbreak.html canvas=265 col=2 %} formed from loose sand on a table top, no 
matter how much care were used. The corresponding limit is found in reducing newsprint on photographic film. When the reduction is carried below twenty diameters, 
the letters begin to blur over; at twenty-five diameters the blurring is very noticeable; at thirty-six diameters, if the greatest care is used, the words are still sufficiently formed to permit faintly legible 
enlargements to be made. Beyond that, everything runs together. 

[^n1]: Mr. Verneur Pratt, of International Filmbook Corporation, comments on this statement: in our opinion, the size of the grain in the original emulsion is not the technological limit. We believe that 
    the present process positive film, either of Eastman, DuPont, Gaevert, or others, is sufficiently 
    fine to permit of reductions up to fifty diameters. ... Our experience is that the reason the developing laboratories cannot secure clean-cut and distinct letters at high ratios of minification is found 
    within the process itself... Our contention is that the individual grains are quite small enough for 
    all practical purposes *before development*; but that when developed in the ordinary manner, these 
    grains clot together in clumps. ... We believe that the future of microcopies on film lies not at all 
    within the province of present film development methods." Mr. Pratt hoped to eliminate grain entirely, and to produce clean-cut microcopies at practically any ratio of minification. He suggests 
    that the success of M. Dagron in making microcopies during the siege of Paris was based on a processing technique that has become a lost art because of the lack of demand for its perfection. 
    
## Reduction Ratio in Copying 

The limit set by the grain of the 
film to the possibility of making photographic reductions of reading matter can 
be called the "resolving power" of the 
film. The standard scientific measure for 
resolving power is in lines per millimeter, 
but this proves to be too refined a measurement for studying the practical usefulness of apparatus on the market under normal working or library conditions. Since 
the final term in the whole process is a 
legible projected image, a rough index of 
the legibility of the product can be used 
to make a comparison of films, cameras and 
treatments of film. Again the newsprint 
can be taken as a standard, and the efficiency of a microcopying process or material can be stated in terms of the number of 
diameters of reduction of 7-point newsprint; this number will be called the "reduction ratio." If the reduction ratio {% include pagebreak.html canvas=265 %} for 7-point newsprint is sixteen diameters, the same material and process should 
copy 14-point type with approximately 
equal efficiency at a reduction of 25 to 
52 diameters. Note, though, that fourteen-point type is not necessarily twice 
the size of a 7-point face. 

Many conditions of a page other 
than the point size of the type will extend 
or limit the possible reduction ratio. The 
body of type (whether heavy or light), the 
spacing of the letters on the line, the 
whiteness of the paper, the blackness of 
the ink, the clearness of the edges of the 
letters---all these things will control the 
resolving power of a photographic emulsion 
as applied to the microcopying of a particular page. For every page, however, 
there is some differential which, for microphotographic purposes, will equate it 
with newsprint. Some specific handicap in 
reduction ratio can be allotted, either to 
the newsprint or the other page, so that 
newsprint reduced by *x* diameters is the 
microphotographic equivalent of the other 
page reduced *y* diameters. The reduction 
ratio is a quantity of fundamental importance governing all cost calculations in 
film copying. What is the highest practicable reduction ratio? 

The limit of the reduction ratio 
in microcopying is set by three factors: 
the resolving power of the emulsion on the 
film or glass; the resolving power of the 
lens and the mechanical perfection of the 
camera; and the workmanship in focusing, 
lighting, timing the exposure, and developing the image. 

## Process—Positive Emulsion 

The most widely used photographic 
emulsion for microcopying is the one that 
happens to be the cheapest---the "process 
positive" emulsion used in making positive 
prints in moving picture work, or in photogravure. This emulsion is manufactured 
to respond to the blacks and whites of a 
photographic negative, and is therefore 
well adapted to render the contrast of 
black and white in copying. 

For a copying problem in which 
faded ink or stained or colored paper is 
involved, a panchromatic emulsion would be 
preferable. The emulsion used by the Recordak Corporation for microcopying is devised to take care of a wide variety of {% include columnbreak.html canvas=266 col=2 %} color contrasts. While not specifically a 
panchromatic film, it is yet more receptive to color contrasts than ordinary process positive emulsion. DuPont quarter-speed pan or Eastman micro-pan is recommended for work involving color. 

There is every prospect that finer 
emulsions will become available, or that 
special processing may render the present 
emulsions capable of higher reduction ratios than they now accept in copying. But 
it remains to be seen whether the prices 
of these special emulsions or processings 
will be sufficiently close to the price of 
process positive film to make them a desirable substitute. In this chapter, except when otherwise stated, the kind of 
photographic emulsion under discussion is 
the process positive. 

## Camera and Lens System 

The efficiency of a camera and 
lens system in affecting the reduction ratio is a product of three factors: the 
quality of the lens itself; the adaptation 
of the mechanism for accurate focusing; 
and the success of the film---holding mechanism in preventing a slight buckling of the 
film. All copying cameras save one hold 
the document still and make exposures one 
at a time through a lens which covers the 
whole film area on which the page is copied. The Recordak apparatus uses a different principle: the documents are copied 
while in motion. The light passes through 
a slit to the moving film, and falls in a 
narrow band across the film. This optical 
system is said to simplify the elimination 
of distortion near the edges of the film. 

It is not easy to isolate these 
factors in appraising the efficiency of a 
camera and lens system, but the writer, 
after some experimentation with a number 
of cameras, has come to the conclusion 
that, taking all factors into account, it 
seems perfectly safe to regard eighteen 
diameters reduction of newsprint as well 
within the capacity of most film, apparatus, and workmanship. Eighteen diameters 
reduction of newsprint should be substantially equivalent to thirty-six diameters 
reduction of fourteen-point type. 

## Limits of Reduction Ratio

As an ultimate limit, a reduction 
of twenty-five diameters of newsprint might {% include pagebreak.html canvas=267 %} conceivably become practical, but at such 
great reductions another consideration 
would have to be taken into account; namely, the amount of light that can be forced 
through a translucent film covered with 
dry gelatin emulsion without damaging it 
by overheating. 

The Eastman Company, in developing 
its Recordak copying machines for documents and newspapers, has allowed a certain 
margin of safety by setting sixteen diameters as its reduction ratio. It also has 
a document copying machine set to make reductions of seventeen, eighteen and four-tenths, and twenty-three diameters. The 
choice of certain of these ratios was probably the consequence, not so much of limitations of resolving power as of convenience in that ordinary business documents 
are 8″ wide and will go easily on 16mm. 
film if reduced seventeen diameters; while 
the newspapers are 18″ wide, and will go 
evenly on a 35mm. film (perforated on one 
side only) at the reduction ratio sixteen. 
The twenty-three diameter reduction is satisfactory for typescript and will put 50% 
more typescript on a foot of film than 
seventeen diameter reduction will put on. 

In comparing the work of different 
cameras, an arbitrary scale of legibility 
was set up, as follows:

- A Legibility: All letters distinct.    
- B Legibility: The edges of the letters begin to blur. {% include columnbreak.html canvas=267 col=2 %} 
- C Legibility: The tops of the "o's" and "a's" are blotted over solid, but the openings are still clear in the "o's", "d's", "p's", and "b's." 
- D Legibility: Almost illegible. The openings of the "s's", "o's", "d's", etc., are blotted solid. Separate words can be deciphered but not read. 
- E Legibility: Absolute illegibility. 

Then seven film copying devices 
(these devices will be described in the 
next chapter) were tested, allowance being 
made in some cases for better and poorer 
runs, or for expert and amateur workmanship. The difference between the worst 
and the best workmanship was much greater 
than the difference between the worst and 
the best apparatus. The conclusions of the 
experiment can be summarized on the following table. 

Another way of demonstrating the 
limits of resolving power is to microcopy 
a page and then enlarge it back to its 
original size. The loss of legibility suffered by the reducing and enlarging process 
will then show itself. 

In the following exhibits, typescript and newsprint have been carried by 
various cameras to varying degrees of reduction and enlarged back to original size. 
These exhibits require careful explanation. 
The most instructive one is that prepared 
by Dr. L. Bendikson and Mr. E. F. Morkisch

[^n2]: The Eastman laboratories estimated on theoretical grounds that the limit of reduction should be 
    about twenty-five diameters for newsprint, and made a test photograph on this scale, which had D legibility. 

 {% include pagebreak.html canvas=268 %} at the Huntington Library, San Marino, 
California (Figure LXIIb). 

Dr. Bendikson was furnished with a 
page (Figure LXIIa) upon which four clippings were pasted, and he was asked to reduce this page by 16 diameters with his 
Leica camera and then enlarge it back to 
original size. But, as can be seen, two 
of the clippings were already reduced 50% 
from original size by photo-offset. Dr. 
Bendikson was asked to enlarge these reduced clippings back to *twice* the size in 
which they came to him. The enlargements 
are here reproduced as Figure LXIIb. At 
the top of the page are the two clippings, 
one of newsprint and the other of typescript, which have been passed through a 
reduction of 16 diameters; at the bottom 
of the page are the two clippings, also of 
newsprint and of typescript, which have 
been passed through a reduction of 32 diameters. The difference in legibility 
that appears in the exhibit registers the 
loss of definition in utilizing the higher
reduction ratio. 

Consider the number of steps, photographic and in printing, that have 
marked the transmission of the two clippings at the bottom of the page: 

1. The original newsprint and typescript 
    were photographed on a negative in a 
    reduction of 50%. 
2. This negative was then burnt into the 
    photo-offset metal sheet. 
3. The metal sheet was inked and printed {% include columnbreak.html canvas=268 col=2 %} via a rubber blanket on paper. (The appearance of newsprint in this reduction 
    can be noted in Figure LIV, a page of 
    the New York Times reduced 50% by photo- 
    offset.) 
4. The photo-offset copies of the two 
    clippings were then photographed on 
    film in an additional reduction of 16 
    diameters, making a total reduction of 
    42 diameters from original size. 
5. The two clippings were then enlarged 
    back 32 diameters on bromide paper. 
6. The bromide paper was then photographed 
    full size on a negative for the photo-offset press. 
7. The negative was burnt into a metal sheet. 
8. The metal sheet was then inked and the 
    ink transmitted via rubber blanket to 
    the page of this book. 
  
The superb photographic craftsmanship of the Huntington Library staff may 
make the test unfair as a true comparison 
of apparatus. The clippings reproduced below were microcopied as follows, from clippings of newsprint and typescript by the 
Folmer Graflex Corporation, in a reduction 
of 16 diameters, and enlarged back to normal size. 

These reproductions are all well 
within the zone of legibility. But it is 
otherwise with the clippings that have 
passed through microcopying from originals 
that were already reduced 50% (Figure 
LXIIc). The effective reduction from the

and the typescript had been reduced to 50% of original size by 
photo-offset before they were again reduced by photography; 
therefore the total microphotographic reduction was 32 diameters, and an enlargement of 32 diameters was necessary to bring them back to full size.

One of the most extraordinary uses 
of microcopying, and seemingly one of the 
most efficient in the history of photography, was the work of Monsieur Dagron during the siege of Paris in 1870. Dagron's 
postal service into the beleagured city 
was set up to use carrier pigeons. To increase the number of words a pigeon could 
carry, messages were printed on a large 
sheet of paper and microphotographed on 
film. The film was then inserted in a 
quill and carried by the pigeon. A piece 
of this film came into the hands of Dr.
Bendikson of the Huntington Library. The 
fragment printed herewith is an enlargement of 32 diameters from the film. The 
exact size of the film, which contains 
eleven pages of three columns each, is also shown. There is no direct evidence to 
establish the size of the print from which 
the microphotograph was made, but by counting the letters in a line, and the number 
of columns per inch, it is possible to estimate that the vertical dimensions of the 
original typography must have been about {% include pagebreak.html canvas=277 %} the same as modern newsprint, and the horizontal dimension somewhat smaller. The 
reduction from which this enlargement was 
made must have been the equivalent of some- 
thing between 32 and 39 diameters from 
newsprint. 

## Cost of Photosensitive Surface 

The cost of the photographic surface used in microcopying varies between 
$.14 and $.50 per square foot. The cheapest film is the motion picture nitrate 
film which sells for $.01 a running foot, 
45mm. wide; but this is, or ought to be, 
excluded from consideration. No nitrate 
film should ever be used for copying work, 
for the cellulose nitrate upon which the 
emulsion is spread is highly unstable in 
the presence of heat. In its chemical composition it is a half-finished high explosive, like a dynamite stopped halfway in 
the course of manufacture. It cannot be 
preserved with safety except in expensive 
vaults and it always brings a fire risk 
with it. 

The so-called "safety film" or 
cellulose acetate has a fire resistance 
about the same as that of paper of similar 
density. Hold a match to a sheet of dry 
cellulose acetate and it will crumble but 
it will not sustain a flame. It has high 
stability---Mr. B. W. Scribner of the Bureau of Standards has stated---equal to the 
best-made papers. Safety film is sold ordinarily at $.015 a running foot in the 
65mm. width. It can sometimes be purchased from firms dealing in odd lengths 
for a lower price, but the $.015 is standard, whether for perforated or unperforated 
film. If the film is perforated on both
sides, one inch is usable between the perforations; this figures out at $.18 per 
square foot of usable photographic surface; 
if the film is perforated on one side only, 
1 1/8″ out of the 35mm. are usable, and 
this makes the usable surface cost $.1605 
per square foot. For unperforated film, 
with 1 1/4″ usable, the price per square 
foot comes to $.144. 

The 16mm. film, perforated on one 
side only, is sold for $.0075 a foot; the 
usable width is .43″ to .5″; therefore the 
price of a usable square foot (28 linear 
feet) is $.21 at the highest, or $.18 at 
the lowest. The 7Omm. film, perforated on 
both sides, is supplied on special order {% include pagebreak.html canvas=278 %} at $.035 a running foot, or $.185 per 
square foot. 

A slightly different emulsion with 
a different weight of supporting film is 
manufactured for use in photoengraving 
work and sold by a different method. Because of these differences, the process 
film cut in rectangles is sold at a higher 
price. A dozen sheets, 5″ x 7″, retail 
for $1.45 list price. Discounts in the 
trade will reduce this in large quantity 
orders, so that the photographic surface 
in this form costs $.50 per square foot in 
small quantities, $.325 per square foot in 
large quantities. The same emulsion *on 
glass* is sold for the same price in the 
same size. 

The tabulation of these figures 
indicates the price range of translucent 
photographic surfaces, whether in the form 
of film or glass, of rectangles or long 
strips: 

TABLE XXXIX 

PRICE PER SQUARE FOOT OF USABLE SURFACE 

| 35mm. moving picture film, perforated both sides | $.18 |
| 35mm. moving picture film perforated one side | .16 |
| 35mm. moving picture film, unperforated | .144 |
| 16mm. moving picture film, perforated one side |.18-.21 |
| 70mm. moving picture film, perforated both sides | .185 |
| 5″ x 7″ process *film or glass* (large lots) | .325 |
| 5″ x 7″ process *film or glass* (small lots) | .50 |

A strip of the 16mm. and a strip 
of 35mm. film are shown in the accompanying sheets. 

These figures for translucent surface are to be compared with those for 
photostat or bromide paper. Insurance bromide paper sells for $3.60 per gross cut 
8″ x 10″, or $.045 per square foot. The 
same price, or in some cases $.005 more or 
less, buys most kinds of photostat paper. 
The difference between $.045 and the prices listed above is paid for the purpose of 
having the photographic image on a translucent medium. Translucency costs from $.10 
to $.28 a square foot.[^n3] {% include columnbreak.html canvas=278 col=2 %} 

[^n3]: Paper in 70mm. strips sells for twice the price of ordinary photostat rolls, but a simple frame with 
a razor blade set in it, will cut the paper in these strips, making the low price available. 

## Film or Glass Versus Paper 

Why is it desirable to use a translucent medium in copying? One part of the 
answer to this question is found in the behavior of light. In discussing the possibilities of reading reduced-size print by 
means of a reading glass, it was stated 
that a "direct" optical system can be used 
in raising the ostensible size of the letters one diameter, but that it soon comes 
to call for more intensive light on the 
surface of the paper than would be required 
if no magnifying were done. The same principle, pressed one degree further, will 
permit a legible image of a page to be projected from a paper copy by reflection in 
a projection lantern if sufficient light 
is focused on the paper. As the enlarging 
ratio increases, it approaches and reaches 
the point where the surface of the paper 
will not reflect sufficient light to make 
the projected image legible. At this 
point the translucent medium becomes useful, for light sufficient to render legible 
a projected image of a reduction up to 25 
diameters (and perhaps beyond that) can be 
forced through the film or the glass. The 
additional cost of the translucent photographic medium must justify itself by the 
increased utilization of light in the projection process, which renders possible 
the greater reduction ratios that are 
standard in microcopying.

THE USE OF 16MM. FILM IN LIBRARY WORK

In the past year, considerable progress has been made in equipment and 
technique for copying various records on film. The technique of micro-copying, 
combined with the use of WPA labor, opens a new field for achievement of large-scale objectives, hitherto abandoned as too expensive for the average institution. 

The Recordak Corporation, of 350 Madison Avenue, New York City, 
using regular commercial equipment and specially developed equipment has done 
considerable work along this line. Sometime ago, Recordak equipment was used 
to photograph the NRA and AAA hearings in Washington on 16mm. film. Positive copies of this film record were sold to libraries throughout the country. 

Recently, Dr. T. R. Schellenberg and others, with the cooperation of the 
Recordak Corporation, worked out a plan for the photographing of library cards. 
The general procedure as planned involves the filming of the catalogues of all the 
libraries in a region, and the typing of library cards from the film copies to make a 
master catalogue. For the reading of the film, the typists use Recordak projectors, 
which enlarge the film copies to original size. 

For $5.50 worth of film (200 feet), including developing, 10,000 library 
catalogue cards can be copied. The plan is ideal, as cards can be photographed at 
a high rate of speed with absolute accuracy, minimum disturbance of library 
routine, simplicity of operation, and at a lower cost than could possibly be 
attained with any other method. Two large centers, Cleveland and Philadelphia, 
are pioneering in this field by making union catalogues of their library holdings. 

The attached film contains pictures of a number of standard library cards.

PRESERVATION OF NEWSPAPERS 
BY PHOTOGRAPHY 

(Reprinted, by permission, from 
Bulletin of American Newspaper 
Publishers Association) 


By W. E. WINES, 

Manager Mechanical Department 

A photographic method and apparatus for reproducing newspaper pages 
in reduced size, so that newspaper files may consist of small reels of negative film 
instead of bulky bound volumes, has been announced by Eastman Kodak Company 
and was exhibited in New York by Charles Z. Case. This is a development of the 
Recordak system which has been in use for eight years by banks and mercantile 
companies for making photographic records of checks and bills. The process 
consists of two steps or stages. The pages of any issue are first photographed consecutively on a sensitized film 1⅜ inches wide, by means of a special camera which 
photographs the pages with great rapidity---approximately 30 pages a minute. For 
viewing the film, a special projector or viewing apparatus has been devised which 
produces an image the linear dimensions of which are 1½ times those of the 
original printed page. A column 2 inches wide is enlarged by the projector to 
3 inches and the height of the letters is magnified in the same ratio. 

THE FILM. 

The film used is similar to the standard 35-mm. film used in professional 
moving picture cameras but differs in two important particulars. The first is 
that the base which carries the sensitive emulsion is the non-inflammable cellulose 
acetate, used in amateur movie cameras, instead of the highly combustible cellulose 
nitrate, commonly used for professional moving picture work. Mr. Case says that 
the National Board of Fire Underwriters rates this "safety" film as offering no 
more fire hazard than the same quantity and form of newsprint. The second

Briefly stated, the outstanding advantages 
of this method are: 

A tremendous reduction in space required to 
house newspaper files. The film record requires 
less than 2% of the storage space required by 
the original bound volumes. 

The film record is a much more permanent one 
than the present bound volumes. This record 
can be renewed as desired thus preserving the 
files indefinitely. 

The files can be referred to much more easily 
with the new method. They can be retained 
where they are immediately available and the 
moving about of large bound volumes is 
eliminated. 

The cost is exceedingly small = being only 
1-1/5¢ per page for standard size newspaper 
pages. Consequently 1,000 pages will cost 
only $12.00 which is little more than the 
present binding cost. 

RECORDAK CORPORATION 

 {% include pagebreak.html canvas=283 %} 

 {% include pagebreak.html canvas=284 %} 

difference is that this film is perforated on only one edge, thus allowing more 
usable area on the same total width. One foot of film negative carries eight and 
a fraction newspaper pages or approximately 825 to 850 pages on 100 feet of 
film. The pages are arranged lengthwise on the film. 

THE CAMERA. 

The camera, which might more properly be called a photographing machine, 
is almost wholly automatic in action. The newspapers to be photographed are 
fed in one page at a time, very much as sheets are fed into a cylinder press or 
mimeograph. Since the photographing of an entire month's edition will require 
only thirty minutes, more or less, it would hardly pay any newspaper to purchase 
one of these cameras. Newspaper publishers ship the month's file of newspapers to 
Rochester each month and pay for the negative film at a price of 10 cents per foot. 
If more than one film is desired from the same lot of papers, duplicates are made 
at a cost of 5 cents per foot. These prices cover the film itself as well as the items 
of exposure and development. This charge for the first negative is equivalent to 
1⅕ cents per page, and for the positive duplicate copies, ⅗ of a cent per page. 

A reel of one hundred feet of film occupies a storage space 1⅝x3¾x3¾ 
inches and carries at least 850 newspaper pages. When asked concerning the life 
of the film, Mr. Case replied that no one really knows how long a negative film 
will last, as none has yet become useless from age. It may last 100 years or 
more. As it is a comparatively simple and inexpensive matter to duplicate the film 
at any time, the length of life of film is not really a vital matter. Mr. Case also 
stated that bound volumes of old issues can be reproduced and preserved by this 
method, but that to do so it would be necessary to take the volumes apart. 

THE PROJECTOR. 

The projector or viewing device is shown in the accompanying illustration. 
The base measures approximately 15 by 18 inches, and the total height is a 
little over 3 feet. The reel of film is mounted on a carrier on top of the apparatus, 
as shown, and is unwound and rewound as desired by means of a crank mounted 
on the right side of the casing, as is shown in the illustration. Since the pages are 
arranged in consecutive order on the film, any page desired may be easily and 
quickly located. The projector shows both 16 and 35 mm. film, 

In the base of the projector is a roll of dull surfaced paper 15 inches wide. 
The free end of this roll is pulled over the base and forms the screen upon which 
the film pictures are projected. As the surface becomes soiled a clean section is 
pulled down and the soiled portion is torn off. The screen shows one-quarter of 
a newspaper page at a time. 

It will be noticed from the illustration that four columns of an 8-column 
page are visible. The knob and lever mounted on the left side of the case are 
employed for shifting the film, carrier and optical system forward or backward or 
to right or left so as to bring into the field of view the exact portion of the page 
which the operator desires to read. Records photographed on 16 mm. film appear 
in their entirety on the screen. The source of light is a 200-watt lamp protected 
by a guard as shown. The apparatus is designed to prevent injury to the film by 
heat, no matter how long the film may be exposed to the light of the lamp. The 
cabinet protects the image on the screen from interference by extraneous light 
sources, thus allowing the projector to be used in any room under normal lighting 
conditions. 

If a copy of any particular article or story is desired, this can be obtained 
photographically by laying a piece of photographic paper on the screen so that 
the sensitized surface receives the image. If a print of a whole page is desired, 
this may be made from the negative by the process commonly employed for making 
enlarged photographic prints. The price of the projector is $185.00. 

Newspapers in various parts of the country are now photographing their 
editions by the Recordak method and are using Recordak Library Projectors for 
reading the film. Several libraries are now using film copies of newspapers that 
they ordinarily kept on their shelves in bound form. The use of film copies 
materially reduces the space required to house the bound volumes, eliminates the {% include pagebreak.html canvas= 285 %} cost of binding and provides a permanent record. These libraries are using 
Recordak Library Projectors for reading from the films. 

Recently the Recordak Corporation photographed the editions of the New 
York Times from January 1, 1914, to December 31, 1918. Positive copies of this 
New York Times film for the 5 years of the World War have been ordered by a 
number of libraries. The cost of the film copies for the entire 5 years is $433.74. 
Individual years may be purchased if desired.

possible reduced-scale copying methods 
from the standpoint of costs of surface 
can be established if we consider the cost 
of copying 256 square feet of printed matter (the equivalent of 93 pages of the 
New York *Times*, or of an octavo book of 
approximately 300 pages). It is evident 
that this amount of printed matter can be 
copied at different reduction ratios on 
areas of photographic surface at the following costs: 

TABLE XL 

COMPARATIVE PRICES OF PHOTOGRAPHIC SURFACE ON PAPER, GLASS, AND FILM; 
WITH REDUCTION RATIOS TO BRING PRICES TO COMMON LEVELS. FIGURES FOR 
256 SQUARE FEET OF PAGES REDUCED PHOTOGRAPHICALLY BY THE FOLLOWING REDUCTION RATIOS 

| | 6 | 8 | 11 | 16 | 22 1/2 |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| Price of 5″ x 7″ glass | | | | $.32 1/2 | $.16 |
| Price of 35mm. film, perforated one side | | | $.32 | $.16 | $.08 | 
| Price of photostat paper | $.36 | $.18 | | | |

It is worth noting that the lower 
threshold for reading glass legibility, 
set in the preceding chapter at 7 diameters reduction from typescript, would 
permit the copying of this 256 square feet 
of paper on 5.2 square feet of photographic surface, the price of which would 
be $.23. If the photostatic reduction on 
paper were to be four diameters, the price 
of the paper would be $.72; a reduction of 
two diameters (i.e., to one-half normal 
size) would require photostat paper costing $2.88. 

These figures indicate a very interesting problem in planning the use of 
photography in scholarship. The zone 
from 6 to 8½ diameters of reduction on 
*paper* corresponds in materials cost to 
the zone of 11 to 16 diameters on *film*, 
16 to 22½	 diameters on *glass*. Processing costs under present conditions probably give additional advantages to the 
film strips in the case of a long series 
of pages that will fill 100 feet or more 
of film, but this advantage in favor of 
film may be reversed in the case of short 
items, especially when a number of positive copies are required. {% include columnbreak.html canvas=287 col=2 %} 

Reading apparatus for paper in reductions of 6 to 8 diameters has not 
been developed as far as that for film in 
reductions of 16 diameters; there is no 
reading apparatus at all for glass, and 
reading machines for film positives made 
from rectangular glass plates with multiple 
exposures have not yet been brought to perfection in design. Storage and filing of 
paper in short items may prove less costly 
than storage and filing of film; glass 
would probably cause higher storage costs, 
but would have possible advantages in durability. The fundamental choice between 
the long strip and the rectangle, between 
paper, film and glass, between the low reduction ratios required by paper and the 
high ratios permitted by glass are not conclusively indicated by the present state of 
technology and experiment. But precisely 
because the use of moving picture film has 
been more highly developed as a quantity 
industry, it is to to this medium that most of 
the experiment and development has been directed, and consequently it is in terms of 
the use of this medium that the whole problem of microcopying can be best presented 
at this time. 

For that reason the analysis of the 
possibilities of microcopying on the following pages will assume standard moving 
picture film in the standard widths of 16mm., 
35mm., and 70mm. as the norm, and treat paper and glass or rectangular film as possible exceptions. 

The Simplified Practice Division of 
the Department of Commerce has asked for an 
agreement by all those promoting microcopying to adapt all apparatus to the 16mm. and {% include pagebreak.html canvas=288 %} 35mm. widths. In replying to the Division 
of Simplified Practise recommendation, circulated in September 1935, the writer, as 
chairman of the Joint Committee on Materials for Research, made the reservation 
that simplified practice should not exclude at this time a size of film that 
will permit of vertical filing, and coördinate with the use of paper and glass. 
But for the copying of a long fixed series 
of material, it seemed best to concur in 
this standardization of film width. A 
"long fixed series" is any amount of documentation that will require 100 feet or 
more of film for copying, and will not 
call for the insertion of a newly photographed item between two items already 
photographed. 

## Full Use of Area of Moving Picture Film 

When 16mm., 35mm., or 7Omm. film 
is used for microcopying, one dimension of 
the photographic image is rigidly fixed; 
it cannot exceed the usable width of the 
film, nor can it be less than the width of 
the film without causing a wastage of 
photosensitive surface. The dimension 
along the length of the film is variable 
provided the photographing is done in a 
camera, such as the Filmograph or Recordak, 
which permits the operator to vary the 
amount of film used at each exposure. But 
the crosswise dimension is fixed, and 
therefore, attention must be given to the 
placing of the photographic image on the 
film. The same principle of maximum use 
of area that was found operative in photo-offset work is applicable to microphotography. Just as it is wasteful to print a
6″ x 9″ book on an 11″ x 17″ photo-offset {% include columnbreak.html canvas=288 col=2 %} metal sheet, so it is wasteful to make on 
35mm. film an image only 3/4″ wide. 

There are three, or possibly four 
positions in which book pages may be copied 
on moving picture film. The position 
chosen for photographing a book on the full 
width of the film determines the reduction 
ratio. The three positions, hereafter 
called first, second and third, are illustrated on the following diagram. 

The relation of these book positions to the reduction ratios can be illustrated by calculating the reduction ratio 
of a book 6″ x 9″ in all three positions 
on the two kinds of film, 35mm. and 16mm. 
The corresponding variation in cost of 
photosensitive surface can be illustrated 
by calculating the footage and price of 
film necessary to copy 100 pages in each of 
the positions and on each of the widths of 
film. 

Verneur Pratt, president of the International Filmbook Corporation, has proposed that the reading material might be 
arranged in a fourth way---the lines of 
print running across the film, making a 
column the full length of the film but 
leaving space on the film for more than 
one column. 

If Mr. Pratt's plan for multiple 
exposures on strips should be applied to 
70mm. film, from 8 to 12 columns of ordinary book pages reduced 16 to 20 diameters could be run on the width of the film. 
There is at present no apparatus for making photographs in this way, but the price 
of film for 100 pages can none the less be 
calculated. A hundred pages would go on 
4½ to 9 linear inches of film, the 
price of which would be $.015 to $.0275.

## Processing Costs 

The processing costs for microcopies are like the costs of the photographic surface in that they apply to a 
footage of film strips, or, roughly, an 
area of film. 

There are two kinds of processing 
involved in microcopying: first, the developing and fixing of the negative; and 
second, the making of contact or other 
prints from the negative. If a unique 
copy only of a book or document is desired, 
there is no need for the second processing. 

The commercial processing of film 
has been organized in two kinds of business enterprise. Short strips of film are 
processed for the amateur photographer by 
services available in every drug store. 
Long runs of moving picture film are processed at prices that may be much less per {% include pagebreak.html canvas=289 col=2 %} film area than those charged by the ordi- 
nary service. 

The short five-foot strips of film 
used in such cameras as the Leica and Contax can usually be developed (but not 
printed as positive contact prints) at the 
corner drug store. The charge is usually 
$.15 or $.20---hence $.03 or $.04 a foot. 
One New York specialist in developing the 
five-foot rolls charges $.30 or $.06 a 
foot. Many users of these small microcopying cameras do their own processing. 

Film strips of 100 feet or more in 
length can be processed in the film laboratories serving the moving picture industry. 
Quotations from a number of laboratories, 
analyzed to make allowance for various 
special charges connected with sound track 
printing, establish the following scale: 

## TODO

TABLE XLII 

PRICES OF FILM PROCESSING 

| | Processing Alone | Including Film |
|-----|-----|-----|
| For developing 35mm. film, per foot | 1¢ to 4¢ | 2 1/2¢ to 5 1/2 ¢ |
| For making a 435mm. per foot | 1¢ to 4¢ | 2 1/2¢ to 5 1/2¢ |
| For developing 16mm. film, per foot | 1¢ | 2 1/4¢ to 5¢ |
| For making a 16mm. contact print, per foot | 1 1/2¢ to 4 1/2¢ | 
| For reducing a 35mm. negative to a 16mm. positive, price inclusive of cost of 16mm. | | 1 1/4¢ to 2¢ |

 {% include pagebreak.html canvas=290 %} The variation in prices is not only a difference that appears from firm to
firm, but also responds to differences in
footage, and in number of prints to be
taken from the same negative. The minimum
prices appear at 10,000 feet of film where
this is the basis of the differential, or
at five prints from the same negative
where the differential 1s based on number
of prints.

The Recordak Corporation operates
on a somewhat different basis; it sells
the film and processing as one unit and
throws in a metal reel and pasteboard box
container to boot. The price of 200 feet
of 16mm. film is $5.50, which includes the
processing. The film is not the ordinary
positive emulsion, and is not available
without the processing. But if it were
quotable at $.0075 a foot, the processing
and servicing elements in the price would
stand at $.0188 a foot. This price includes not only special processing for contrast and permanence, but also servicing
in the cutting of short strips of film,
packaging, and mailing.

The Recordak Corporation also offers for sale 35mm. prints of certain newspaper files. The file for the New York
*Times* has been microcopied for the years
1914--1918 inclusive---a total of almost
90,000 pages; the set of films is on sale
for $.66 per 100 pages. Figures presented
by the Recordak Corporation during the
planning of this project indicated that
that part of the cost which is represented
by the printing off of the positive copies {% include pagebreak.html canvas=290 col=2 %} (not including price of the film) is figured at $.04 per foot.

In estimating processing costs of
the long rolls of film, account must be
taken of the possibility that this work
may be done by the individual or institution which does the photographing. The
large, continuous process machines used in
the moving picture industry would not be
practicable for such work, but a Stineman
developing reel, taking 100 feet of film,
can be purchased for $32.00; the chemicals
for developing 100 feet of 35mm. film cost
about $.10. Automatic printing machinery
for the 100-foot film strips is also available, and is not too bulky to be part of
the equipment of a photographic department
of a library.

Processing costs, like reduction
ratios, introduce a very significant variable into microcopying. The lower priced
processing may or may not be inferior to
the more costly. The effect upon costs is
illustrated by taking the figures on film
footage required for 100 pages of a 6″ x
9″ book, as given above, and figuring in
with them the high and low processing costs.
Note that high processing costs can make it
more expensive to copy at the reduction ratio of 21 diameters on 16mm. film than to
copy with lot processing costs at a reduction of 12 diameters on 35mm. film. The
gains in cost of materials that may be
made by increasing the reduction ratio may
conceivably be frittered away if the high
reduction ratio renders necessary a more
expensive processing. On the other hand,

 {% include pagebreak.html canvas=291 %} resort to low processing costs may entail a low reduction ratio, and hence the saving in processing may be sacrificed by in- 
creasing the material cost. 

Just as in calculating typescript 
book costs it was necessary to assume arbitrarily an average typing charge before 
proceeding to further comparative studies, 
so in calculating microcopying costs an arbitrary average processing figure will be 
assumed. The difference between the price 
of developing a negative and the price of 
making a positive print from a negative 
will be ignored; it does not appear in 
most quotations. Processing will be figured regularly at $.0175 for 16mm., $.025 
for 35mm. film; the joint cost of film and 
processing will stand then at $.025 for 
1é6mm., $.04 for 35mm. film. It is under- 
stood that these prices are available only 
in large footages, running into the thousands of feet. Maximum figures for shorter runs, when necessary, will be assumed 
at $.03 for 16mm. film, $.05 for 35mm., to 
include film and processing. Very short 
runs of a few inches only introduce a special problem which will be separately analyzed. 

## First Costs and Running Costs in Microcopying 

The application of microcopying to 
the distribution of reading matter is so 
new, the price levels at which it operates 
so revolutionary, that the fundamental elements of cost as they appear in publishing 
are not apparent at first glance, and yet 
they are present. In microcopying, as in 
other techniques, there is the antithesis 
between a cost curve that falls with each 
additional number of copies and a cost 
curve that remains constant regardless of 
the number of copies that are made. In 
other words, there is a *first cost* and a 
*running cost*. The first cost includes the 
labor of making a photograph and processing 
the negative film; the running cost is the 
cost of making each additional positive 
from the negative. 

There may arise many situations in 
which there will be no positives made from 
the negative. The original negative will 
be made as a unique copy for a single purchaser. The cost of this unique copy will 
consist of two elements: first, labor in 
photography; second, film and processing. {% include pagebreak.html canvas=291 col=2 %} This situation will be studied first, and 
then its implications traced in those cases 
where a number of positive copies are to be 
made from a single negative for a number of 
purchasers. The cost of making this negative stands, however, as a "first cost," 
comparable, for instance, with the cost of 
setting type and fitting it in a press, or 
preparing mimeograph stencils or photo-offset metal sheets. It is absolutely independent of the number of copies that are 
to be made from the negative. 

How is this cost to be estimated in 
the case of long runs of material? As in 
so many other situations, the most expensive and specialized apparatus reduces the 
labor cost. The small, non-specialized 
cameras such as the Leica or Contax correspond to hand-set type in printing, and the 
large, highly-specialized cameras, such as 
the Recordak, Filmograph, Kennedy, and perhaps the new Graflex, correspond to the 
linotype in efficiency. 

Experience in photographing large 
collections of documents has been most amply obtained by the Filmograph Corporation 
and by Lloyd B. Kennedy in copying land title abstract records, and by the Recordak 
Corporation in a variety of copying enterprises. 

Filmograph and Kennedy experiences 
agree in establishing that one operator can 
copy 10,000 pages of bound records per day; 
Dr. T. R. Schellenberg, using a Recordak to 
copy the unbound typescript pages of the 
NRA and AAA hearings, also copied 10,000 
pages a day. In all these cases there was 
material in hundreds of thousands of pages, 
uniform in size, continuous in supply. The 
May Company of Cleveland uses a Recordak to 
copy its internal records. The operators 
photograph 20,000 statements, 7″ x 10″, per 
day. Speed records with the new Recordak 
bound book copying camera are not available. 
It is safe to conclude that experience with 
uniform and continuous matter, whether 
bound or unbound, permits an estimate of 
10,000 pages a day as a maximum. 

While these automatic machines can 
be operated by relatively unskilled labor, 
it is not too much to count the labor cost
at $10.00 per day, which might cover the 
wages of two operators, one to do the photographing, the other to bring the material 
to the machine and return it to place. 

This labor cost is independent of {% include pagebreak.html canvas=291 %} the reduction ratio and hence of the amount 
of film used in a given copying job. But 
with the film used at a reduction ratio of 
16 to 23 diameters, and processing costs 
figured at their average for long runs, the 
cost of film and processing should stand 
somewhere near the labor cost---perhaps 
$10.00 worth of labor will photograph 
$12.00 to $15.00 worth of film (including 
processing). At this rate the first cost 
---i.e., the finished negative---of microcopied material in large runs can be made 
for $.22 to $.25 per 100 pages. This is 
the cost at which a unique copy of a great 
body of material could be made for a single 
purchaser. 

But if a number of purchasers 
should wish to acquire the same material, 
the cost of making the positive copies for 
each would be exactly the film-and-processing charge for film plus a pro-rata fraction of the first cost divided among the 
purchasers. The behavior of costs in this 
situation can be illustrated from two cases: first, the actual experience of the 
Joint Committee on Materials for Research 
in distributing microcopies of the hearings 
held under the NRA and AAA; and second, the 
estimated costs of a project for copying 
two million pages of books printed in England before 1640---a project that would 
bring to subscribing libraries copies of 
all books listed in *Pollard and Redgrave 
Short Title Catalogue*. 

The Joint Committee arranged with 
the Agricultural Adjustment Administration 
and the National Recovery Administration to 
make microcopies of the hearings. The total number of typescript pages was approximately 315,000. The reduction ratio was 
23 diameters. The cost of making the negative, including Recordak rental, film and 
film developing was $455.00 for 13,400 feet 
of 16mm. film. The cost of making additional positives was $368.50 each. The 
whole project was figured to distribute the 
cost of making the negative among ten subscribers, making the cost of the microcopies of the 315,000 pages $413.50 or 
$.13 per 100 pages. 

The work of microcopying this great 
body of material was carried to a successful conclusion by Dr. T. R. Schellenberg, 
in spite of many obstacles. The material 
consisted of unbound typescript pages, some 
of them carbon copies on thin paper, to{%- include columnbreak.html canvas=292 col=2 -%}gether with a number of printed pamphlets. 
When the material was first filmed, the operative employed to feed the pages skipped 
some of them or fed them into the Recordak 
machine in an irregular way. Moreover, the 
machine itself was not set to take care of 
the photographic differences between light 
and dark copies, or between bond and onionskin paper. When a check up of the first 
film copy of the NRA records revealed imperfections, an effort was made to correct 
them by cutting the microcopy strips and 
interspersing freshly photographed strips 
of film in the faulty places. But this 
film strip, when used for making positive 
copies, did not prove satisfactory. Dr. 
Schellenberg therefore recopied the whole 
file of NRA hearings, with the technical 
help of members of the staff of the Recordak Corporation, which was very generous, 
not only in solving technical difficulties, 
but also in contributing free of charge the 
machine and film for the second copying. In 
calculating and assessing the cost of the 
project, the extra copying operation was 
not taken into account, for it was the result of conditions which need not be duplicated in the future, and is charged off to 
experiment and experience. 

A project to make widely available 
copies of all early printed English books 
has been under discussion among librarians 
for several years, and has led to a number 
of cost calculations. The project differs 
from that of copying the AAA and NRA hearings, not only in its greater magnitude, 
but also in the greater expense that must 
necessarily be incurred in travel and supervision, and in setting and resetting the 
camera to take volumes of different sizes 
at different reduction ratios. A memorandum on cost was drawn up at the office of 
the Joint Committee in September, 1935. 
For purposes of calculation it was assumed 
that the total number of pages would be two 
million, and the average page size an octavo in twelve-point type. The calculation 
was made to cover two alternatives in reduction ratio---12 diameters and 21 diameters, and the alternative of using 45mm. 
or 16mm. film. The memorandum on cost, 
while rather elaborate, serves to illustrate the behavior of so many of the variables in microcopying that it is here 
quoted textually: 

The first cost of making an original {% include pagebreak.html canvas=292 %} negative of the estimated two million pages is hard to calculate and not greatly dependent on reduction ratio, for so much of 
it will be travel, supervision, apparatus 
and labor of incalculable efficiency. 
These costs, exclusive of film cost, could 
be calculated for two million pages as follows: 

|-----|-----:|
| Labor cost | $8,000.00 
| Fare, supervision | 6,000.00 | 
| Miscellaneous | 2,000.00 |
| Indexing | 2,000.00 |
| Total | $18,000.00 |

Other costs are variable with the 
number of feet of film used. On 35mm. film 
in the third position, reduced 12 diameters, 2,000,000 pages (750,000 linear feet 
of book) would go on approximately 62,500 
feet of film plus 10% for margin, bringing 
the total roughly to 70,000 feet. On 16mm. 
film in second position, reduced 21 diameters, 2,000,000 pages (1,000,000 feet of 
book) would go on 48,000 feet of film plus 
10% for margin, bringing the total to 
56,000 feet. The cost for the film and the 
processing for 35mm. film, if figured at 
$.04 a foot, is $2,800; for the 16mm. film, 
figured at $.025 a foot, it is $1,325. 

Resuming our calculations, the difference in reduction ratio and film cost 
becomes increasingly important as the number of subscribing libraries increases. The 
possibility will also appear that very substantial reductions in the processing cost 
of the film may become available if the 
footage runs high enough. However, maintaining the constant calculation of $.025 
for the 16mm., $.04 for the 35mm. film the 
costs for subscribing libraries would stand 
as follows: 

| 10 libraries | $4,880 at 12 diameters, 35mm. film; or $.24 per 100 pages | 
| | $3,257.50 at 21 diameters, 16mm. film; $.165 per 100 pages | 
| 20 libraries | $3,840 at 12 diameters, 35mm. film; or $.20 per 100 pages | 
| | $2,292 at 21 diameters, 16mm. film; or $.115 per 100 pages |
| 40 libraries | $3,520 at 12 diameters, 45mm. film; or $.17 per 100 pages |
| | $1,808 at 21 diameters, 16mm. film; or $.09 per 100 pages |

By the time forty libraries are {% include columnbreak.html canvas=293 col=2 %} reached, the cost of film and processing 
has become dominant and any economies in 
these costs would be felt immediately. 

The effect of differences in processing costs when the number of subscribers 
reaches 40 is shown by recalculating the 
costs at maximum and minimum processing 
figures ($.055 maximum and $.025 minimum for 
35mm. film; $.05 maximum and $.0225 minimum 
for 16mm. film). 

| 40 libraries | $1,750 at 12 diameters, 35mm. film; or $.09 per 100 pages (film and processing at $.025 | |
| | $4,397 at 12 diameters, 35mm. film; or $.22 per 100 pages (film and processing at $.055 per foot) | (Difference of $647 between high and low processing) |
| | $1,672.32 at 21 diameters, 16mm. film; or $.085 per 100 pages (film and processing at $.0225 per foot) | | 
| | $3,167 at 21 diameters, 16mm. film; or $.16 per 100 pages (film and processing at $.05 per foot) | (Difference of $1,494.68 between high and low processing) |

## Microcopying "Reprint Costs" 

Microcopying, like book production, 
as has been stated, gives rise to both 
"first cost" and "running cost." The 
first cost in microcopying is compounded 
of two factors, the first of which is 
largely labor, and is dependent upon the 
number of pages copied, regardless of the 
area of film used; the second is film and 
processing, and is dependent upon the area 
of film used, regardless of the number of 
pages copied upon it. The labor cost of 
photographing is roughly analogous to the 
composition cost of book manufacture; it 
varies with the number of pages rather than 
the number of words. The running cost 
(that is to say, the cost that depends upon 
the number of copies) is simply the area 
cost of the first copy, multiplied by the 
size of edition. 

Another kind of cost is present in 
book manufacturing, the "reprint cost." 
This is the "first cost" of bringing out a 
second edition. The reprint cost is less 
than the first cost of the first edition 
of a book provided plates are made from 
the type, or the photo-offset metal sheets {% include pagebreak.html canvas=294 %} preserved for a second run. But the reprint cost in book manufacture, regardless 
of these economies, is always substantial. 
In microcopying large footages the reprint 
cost is nil. No special expense is incurred in production if, when 10,000 feet 
of film have been distributed to each of 
ten subscribing libraries, an eleventh library comes along a year later and asks to 
have an eleventh copy made for it. The 
cost of making the eleventh copy is simply 
the normal film-and-processing cost. For 
this reason microcopying offers remarkable 
elasticity in the distribution of material. 
There need never be an "overprint," made 
at the risk that no one will wish to buy 
it. This quality of microcopying, it must 
be remembered, is present only to the degree that the footage involved in a single 
order is large enough to obtain low processing prices. 

## Short Footages in Unique Copies 

An application of microcopying 
that is already developing, and promises 
to have great utility in the future, is the 
making of microcopy negatives of books or 
periodical articles upon the order of individual purchasers, whether research workers or libraries. The installation of efficient photographic equipment may make it 
possible for a large library to make its 
resources generally available to readers 
anywhere at the price level of microcopying. 

If the number of pages to be copied per day in a library should be large 
enough to allow the continuous operation of 
the machine, the operating cost would rise 
above that of a long run of uniform material only to the extent that readjustments 
of focus became necessary in changing from 
books of one page size to books of another 
'Size. The processing costs could still 
stand at the level of long rum work. An 
additional charge would be incurred in cutting up the strips and mailing the short 
lengths to the various purchasers, but 
this type of service, in the experience of 
the Recordak Corporation (which cuts up 
long strips of bank records and mails them 
to individual banks) would not lift the 
costs to an entirely new level. Bookkeeping costs would appear, but it seems quite 
probable that on large-scale work the 
price level could be held down within {% include columnbreak.html canvas=294 col=2 %} striking distance of the price of long-footage orders. 

## Microcopying and Long-Distance Use of Libraries: the "Bibliofilm Service" 

The most interesting effort to develop a service of this kind has been made 
by Mr. Atherton Seidell, Dr. R. H. Draeger 
of the U. S. Navy Department and Miss 
Claribel Barnett, librarian of the Department of Agriculture Library, Washington, 
D. C. In November 1934, Miss Barnett established the "Bibliofilm Service" in the 
Library of the Department of Agriculture. 
The date is an important one in the history 
of microcopying applications. 

Miss Barnett has described the administrative routine of the Bibliofilm 
Service in an article in *The Camera* vol. L, 
no. 5, May 1935, pp. 327-328, as follows: 

> The procedure begins "with the suppliance of a 5″ x 5″ slip or card specifying the article desired---one such 
    slip for each and every article, and 
    each slip carrying the name and address of the customer. The slips are 
    returned with the finished films. Attendants take the slips, search the 
    library, send the books to the photographing room, there each article is 
    copied on a continuous strip of film, 
    leaving spaces between for cutting. 
    When all the day's orders are photographed, the film will be developed, 
    fixed, washed and dried, then cut up 
    and each sequence attached to its 
    proper slip and mailed to the customer or delivered by hand as it may 
    be. Prepayment for the service is 
    urged when possible, this to save accounting, etc., and a deposit of funds 
    which may be drawn upon is possible. 
  
The film copies or "filmstats" as 
they are called are priced at $.10 for each 
article not exceeding ten pages, and $.05 
for each additional ten pages. The increasing use of the Bibliofilm Service is 
evident from a report in *Agricultural Library Notes* for June, 1935; the number of 
pages copied per month rose from 470 in November 1934, to 6,597 in May 1935. 

Miss Barnett writes that the rates 
during this experimental period have not 
covered the cost of keeping the records {% include pagebreak.html canvas=295 %} and correspondence, but that the clerical 
cost may be materially lessened after the 
procedure has been better established. 
Moreover, the clerical costs as they stand 
are not greater, she believes, than those 
connected with the lending of books, for 
such costs as charging and discharging 
loans, or following up loaned volumes by 
correspondence to secure their return, are 
avoided. Studies of the cost of interlibrary loans made by the University of California---though challenged by some librarians---set the cost of each loan at well 
over a dollar, and offer strong confirmation to the views of Miss Barnett. Scholarship stands much indebted to her for the 
well-conceived initiative. 

Other libraries have installed 
equipment for making microcopies, but the 
cameras used do not have the efficiency of 
the Draeger camera used by the Department 
of Agriculture Library. The price for microcopies at the Library of Congress, the 
New York Public Library, and Yale University Library is set at $3.00 per 100 exposures; at two pages per exposure, this 
amounts to $1.50 per 100 pages. Huntington Library at San Marino, one of the first 
to install equipment, charges $5.00 per 100 
exposures, or $2.50 per 100 pages. A large 
microcopying machine has been installed in 
the Preussische Staatsbibliothek, but no 
quotations on service have been received 
by the Joint Committee. 

Since installation of equipment in 
America has already reached three of the 
largest libraries in the country, it is 
safe to say that at this very moment microcopies of several million volumes of books 
and periodicals are already available to 
research workers at a price ($1.50 per 100 
pages) not much in excess of the normal 
price paid for books. Since the Wilson 
Union List of Periodicals in American Libraries will inform any reader anywhere 
whether a given volume of a periodical is 
available at one or another of the libraries offering this service, scholars are 
now able to arrange with speed and certainty to have copied for them periodical articles not accessible in their own institutions. 

## Microcopying and Copyright 

While these innovations have offered a mechanical means of increasing the {% include columnbreak.html canvas=295 col=2 %} working power of scholars throughout the 
country, it has been necessary to prepare 
the legal ground for their use. For most 
of the learned journals from which scholars are likely to seek microcopies are covered by copyright. With books it is otherwise; most of the rare and inaccessible 
books are probably the old books, on which 
copyright has expired. But the whole question of photographic copying in its relation to copyright has been full of uncertainties. 

Discussion with specialists in 
copyright problems showed that the law has 
been highly elaborated in court decisions 
to define the limits of so-called "fair 
use" when copyright material is republished 
for profit, but that no court decisions apply to the situation of the research worker 
who copies out notes from a copyrighted 
work in the course of his research. The letter of the statute would seem to indicate 
that the scholar with a fountain pen copying paragraphs out of an article in a 
learned journal was engaged in technical 
violation of the copyright statute, but it 
seemed evident that the courts would necessarily make a distinction between the kind 
of copying that is done in the course of 
research, when the copied matter merely enters a scholar's note file, and the reprinting of material for sale or distribution. 
The librarians had felt for some time that 
the uncertainties of the law hampered them 
in some measure in laying down policies in 
the use of the photostat, and it was clear 
that the extension of microcopying, because 
of the lower price level, would increase 
the problem. 

When the text of the new copyright 
law was under discussion in Washington in 
the spring of 1935, the suggestion was made 
that specific reference in the law should 
cover photographic copying for scholarly 
purposes; but the legal advisers of the 
publishers, while quite willing to have the 
photographic copying devices used to help 
scholars in research, felt that such a provision of the law would necessarily be so 
complex that it might either defeat its own 
purpose or undermine the whole structure of 
copyright.

The whole subject was explored in a 
generous and sympathetic spirit at a meeting of librarians and book publishers. Mr. 
H. M. Lydenberg of the New York Public {% include pagebreak.html canvas=296 %} Library, Mr. Milton Ferguson, chairman of 
the book-buying committee of the American 
Library Association, and Dr. Andrew Keogh 
of Yale University Library met with Mr. 
Frederic Melcher, chairman of the copyright committee, and the board of directors of the National Association of Book 
Publishers. As a result of correspondence 
and conference to which a number of librarians contributed, a "gentlemen's agreement" on photographic copying for research 
purposes was drawn up and signed by Mr. W. 
W. Norton on behalf of the National Association of Book Publishers and by Dr. 
Robert C. Binkley on behalf of the Joint 
Committee on Materials for Research.

The main principles of the agreement are, first, that photographic copies 
of parts of books or periodical volumes 
may be made by a library and delivered 
without profit to a purchaser in lieu of 
loan or manual transcription. The paragraph was phrased to apply to the copying 
of a complete *article* from a periodical {% include columnbreak.html canvas=296 col=2 %} volume, but it would not apply to the microcopying of a whole volume or file of a 
periodical. The second principle is that 
the photographic copy is not to be a substitute for the purchase of the material; 
it can be taken for granted that the known 
practices of research scholars in the collecting of material for research will guide 
the intelligent application of this principle. The third' principle is that the library which carries out the above principles in good faith is not to be held liable 
for violation of copyright law, but that 
responsibility for any possible infringement shall rest with the purchaser of the 
photographic copy. Subsequent correspondence has shown that some photographic copying problems arising in libraries are not 
explicitly covered by the agreement, but 
the main principles are sufficiently clear 
to justify the development of microcopying 
services in lieu of inter-library loans. 

The text of the agreement is reproduced herewith: 

## Correspondence and Agreement on the Photographic Copying by Libraries of Copyrighted Material 

May 25, 1935 

Mr. W. W. Norton, President    
National Association of Book Publishers    
547 Fifth Avenue    
New York, New York

Dear Sir: 

On behalf of the Joint Committee on Materials for Research, I 
write to thank you for the consideration your organization has given to the 
increasing importance of the problem of conscientious observance of copyright 
that faces research libraries in connection with the growing use of photographic methods of reproduction. Not so long ago the scholar or student contented himself with pencil or ink transcripts of passages in the books and 
periodicals he consulted in connection with his studies. The increased use, 
first of the fountain pen, then of the standard typewriter, then of the portable typewriter, developed a corresponding increase in the number and amount 
of transcripts made for this same purpose. Within the past few years, the 
use of photography, the photostat, and now the 16 or 35 millimeter film cameras have added to the amount, the extent, the speed---and the problems---of 
this reproduction. 

We realize, of course, that we can speak only on behalf of the 
publishers, libraries and research workers of this country. The problem is of 
importance also in connection with foreign copyrighted books, particularly the 
publications of academies or learned societies and the unofficial periodical {% include pagebreak.html canvas=297 %} press printing the results of research. As to such books and periodicals, 
the foreign publisher or copyright owner is the final authority. We feel, 
however, that the common interests of both groups would make it fair for us 
to assume that the practice approved by American publishers and libraries 
would satisfy their brothers in other countries. 

We are told that from time to time instructors in various 
schools and colleges have reproduced in one way or another extensive portions or whole chapters from copyrighted textbooks, which have been sold or 
given to their classes as substitutes for the textbooks. We see how keen an 
injustice and how severe a harm is done to the owner of the copyright by such 
practices, and we participate with you in the condemnation of such obvious 
violations of copyright. 

The indication you have given of what publishers and authors, 
as owners of copyright, can suggest to archives offices and museums as a 
guide to a code of fair practice in connection with the commendable form of 
public service rendered by photographic methods of reproduction is so clarifying that we suggest it be put in the form of an agreement and published. 

Very sincerely yours, 

(signed) Robert C. Binkley    
Chairman, The Joint Committee on Materials for Research

May 27, 1935 

Dr. Robert C. Binkley, Chairman    
Joint Committee on Materials for Research    
Western Reserve University    
Cleveland, Ohio 

Dear Dr. Binkley: 

We deeply appreciate your desire to work out a code of fair 
practice which will protect the rights of authors and research workers. As 
publishers we naturally do not wish to impose restrictions which might hamper 
students in collecting research material, but on the other hand it is necessary for us all to face this problem realistically and not permit the rapid 
extension of photocopying to lead to a disregard of the fundamental principles 
of copyright. 

The results of the conference in our office, attended by Mr. 
Lydenberg, Mr. Ferguson, and Dr. Keogh and members of our committee, have 
been discussed with Mr. Frederic Melcher, Chairman of the Association Copy- 
right Committee, and by our Board of Directors. We are happy to have the results of these conferences put in the form of an agreement and published with 
this correspondence. 

Very sincerely yours,

 {% include pagebreak.html canvas=298 %} 

The Joint Committee on Materials for Research and the Board 
of Directors of the National Association of Book Publishers, after conferring on the problem of conscientious observance of copyright that faces research libraries in connection with the growing use of photographic methods 
of reproduction, have agreed upon the following statement: 

> A library, archives office, museum, or similar institution owning 
    books or periodical volumes in which copyright still subsists may 
    make and deliver a single photographic reproduction or reduction of 
    a part thereof to a scholar representing in writing that he desires 
    such reproduction in lieu of loan of such publication or in place of 
    manual transcription and solely for the purposes of research; provided
   
> (1) That the person receiving it is given due notice in writing 
    that he is not exempt from liability to the copyright proprietor for any infringement of copyright by misuse of the 
    reproduction constituting an infringement under the copyright 
    law;
  
> (2) That such reproduction is made and furnished without profit 
    to itself by the institution making it.

> The exemption from liability of the library, archives office or museum 
    herein provided for shall extend to every officer, agent or employee 
    of such institution in the making and delivery of such reproduction 
    when acting within the scope of his authority of employment. This 
    exemption for the institution itself carries with it a responsibility 
    to see that library employees caution patrons against the misuse of 
    copyright material reproduced photographically. 
  
Under the law of copyright, authors or their agents are assured 
of "the exclusive right to print, reprint, publish, copy and vend the copyrighted work," all or any part. This means that legally no individual or institution can reproduce by photography or photomechanical means, mimeograph or 
other methods of reproduction a page or any part of a book without the written 
permission of the owner of the copyright. Society, by law, grants this exclusive right for a term of years in the belief that such exclusive control of 
creative work is necessary to encourage authorship and scholarship. 

While the right of quotation without permission is not provided 
in law, the courts have recognized the right to a "fair use" of book quotations, 
the length of a "fair" quotation being dependent upon the type of work quoted 
from and the "fairness" to the author's interest. Extensive quotation is obviously inimical to the author's interest. 

The statutes make no specific provision for a right of a research worker to make copies by hand or by typescript for his research notes, 
but a student has always been free to "copy" by hand; and mechanical reproductions from copyright material are presumably intended to take the place of hand 
transcriptions, and to be governed by the same principles governing hand transcription. 

In order to guard against any possible infringement of copyright, 
however, libraries, archives offices and museums should require each applicant 
for photomechanical reproductions of material to assume full responsibility for 
such copying, and by his signature to a form printed for the purpose assure the 
institution that the duplicate being made for him is for his personal use only
and is to relieve him of the task of transcription. The form should clearly indicate to the applicant that he is obligated under the law not to use the material thus copied from books for any further reproduction without the express 
permission of the copyright owner.

 {% include pagebreak.html canvas=299 %} It would not be fair to the author or publisher to make possible the substitution of the photostats for the purchase of a copy of the book 
itself either for an individual library or for any permanent collection in a public or research library. Orders for photocopying which, by reason of their 
extensiveness or for any other reasons, violate this principle should not be 
accepted. In case of doubt as to whether the excerpt requested complies with 
this condition, the safe thing to do is to defer action until the owner of 
the copyright has approved the reproduction. 

Out-of-print books should likewise be reproduced only with 
permission, even if this reproduction is solely for the use of the institution 
making it and not for sale.

## "Publishing" Short Runs of Material by Microcopying 

One of the most intricate, and at 
the same time the most important, of the 
problems encountered in the use of microcopying is its possible substitution for 
publication. 

In its simplest form, such a substitution for publication would take place 
automatically if a library which offers 
microcopying service has in its possession 
unpublished material, and the probable purchasers of such material are aware of its 
existence and availability through the 
usual bibliographical guides. For instance, if a typescript copy of a monograph 
should be deposited in the Library of the 
Department of Agriculture, and listed or 
given notice in the learned journals, the 
Public Affairs Information Service, and 
other bibliographical guides, it would be, 
in effect, "published" to the degree that 
scholars would be willing to buy and use 
microcopies of it. 

But in such a case each individual 
purchaser would require that the book be 
photographed anew. A new negative would 
be produced for each "sale" of the book. 

Would it be possible to organize 
the distribution of microcopies of such a 
work in a way that would take advantage of 
the labor-saving that can occur when a 
number of positives are made from a single 
negative? Of course, if the material in 
question fills a large enough film footage, 
the additional copies after the first neg{%- include columnbreak.html canvas=2 -%}ative are available with present technique 
at a price lower than the cost of the first 
negative. But in the case of a short strip 
of film---a few inches or a few feet---there 
is at present no way of taking advantage of 
the theoretically low cost of making a number of prints from a single negative in the 
production of positive prints to order. 
What is the amount and behavior of such anticipated economies? What is the difference between the cost of making a negative 
microcopy from a book and the cost of making a positive from a negative? And what 
is the cost of maintaining a catalogue, and 
shelving or storage system for film negatives? 

It has been shown that, for long 
footages, the cost of making a positive 
from a negative is not greater than the 
processing cost of the same footage of negative. Even short items can be produced 
as negatives at the low processing cost of 
the long footage, because a large number 
of items are copied on a long roll, and the 
roll subsequently cut up. But if positive 
copies are to be made from the short scraps 
of negative, the. processing cost rises. 
Short scraps of negative give rise to high 
costs in making positive copies. But the 
cataloguing and storage expenses for short 
pieces are as high, per item, as for long 
strips. Consequently *for short items it 
will be wasteful to save the negative, for 
long items wasteful not to save it*. The 
dividing line is probably the 100-foot 
reel, which may mean a unit of 2,000 pages. 

 {% include pagebreak.html canvas=300 %} For the shorter items---and this 
means for most scientific literature---present apparatus will not justify the expense 
of holding a negative for the sake of making a number of positives from it. But if
a large number of microcopies of a scientific article are to be made from the same 
paper copy, the paper itself may wear out 
in the repeated photographing. "Publication" by microcopy methods would put upon 
a book the same amount of wear that would 
take place if every reader used the same 
copy. Librarians who have administered 
"reserve book rooms" for large university 
classes know how quickly a book will wear 
out under constant use. 

This is the problem to which Dr. 
Watson Davis of Science Service has devoted a vast amount of intensive thought 
and planning. The solution suggested by 
him is an important contribution to the 
use of microcopying, and to the organization of the distribution of scientific 
literature. He proposes that the negative 
made from an original typescript, or indeed a negative made from a published article or book, should take the form, not 
of a length of film strip but of a rectangle of film, suitable for filing in a card catalogue. It is deemed technically possible to put 150 pages of microcopied material on a 3″ x 5″ card (a 70mm. film cut 
into 5″ strips would measure 2 3/4″ x 5″). 
Even if the number of pages that can be 
copied on such a card is materially less 
than 150 pages, the essential value of his 
suggestion lies in its answer to two of 
the most difficult problems in microcopying short items. For a short strip of
roll film is not easy to store, it must be 
placed in a small compartment or container, 
the container labelled, and then the collection of containers and films controlled 
by a catalogue. If the film copy of the 
article or book can become itself the catalogue card, the problem of cataloguing and 
storing disappears. This is the first advantage of his plan. The second advantage 
appears in connection with processing. To 
make a positive print from' a short strip 
of motion picture film is more difficult 
than to make a print from a single rectangle of film. His plan should tend to make 
"reprint costs" for short items behave as 
if the items were long, and at the same 
time eliminate a heavy cataloguing and 
storing charge. {% include columnbreak.html canvas=300 col=2 %} 

It has been suggested by several 
writers that the future may see whole libraries copied on film, and the negatives 
stored in such a way that positive copies 
from any of them can be run off on demand. 
It is sometimes thought that when a library, 
in responding to a demand for a microcopy 
of an item, makes a negative copy, it 
should make a positive from the negative, 
send the positive to the purchaser, and retain the negative to make positives for 
other purchasers. This is the procedure 
that the technique of photography suggests 
as normal. But how does it fit into the 
practical administration of library re- 
sources? 

In the analysis of library costs, 
it was established that cataloguing and 
shelving of books are items of library expense that approach in magnitude, or even 
pass, the cost of the books themselves. Microcopying in lieu of inter-library lending, 
when organized like the U. S. Department of 
Agriculture Bibliofilm Service, imposes no 
extra cataloguing charges on the library. 
The film service simply uses the existing 
catalogue and shelving system. If an effort is to be made to use a negative more 
than once, the library must control its 
negatives by means of a catalogue system 
that will parallel its book catalogue, 
growing with the growth of the collection 
of negative films. This extra cost can be 
made up only if it results in substantial 
economies. 

Dr. Davis has received from the 
Chemical Foundation a grant which he will 
use to develop the apparatus necessary to 
put his plan into effect. When the apparatus is ready, the day will have arrived 
when microcopying is technically suited to 
do for the intellectual world what publishing has hitherto done, with immeasurably 
greater elasticity and at a fraction of the 
cost. The long roll of film will probably 
remain as the best medium for the microcopying of long items, because it will do 
for the microcopies what binding does for 
a book---keep the series in its fixed order. 
The card negative will serve for the short 
items, arranged in an open order, with new 
items placed between items already in the 
file.

## The Problem of Standardization of Equipment and Reduction Ratio 

A memorandum by Mr. Verneur E. Pratt {% include pagebreak.html canvas=301 col=1 %} of the International Filmbook Corporation, 
and a series of letters and memoranda by 
Dr. Watson Davis, call attention to the 
vital importance of standardization in the 
development of apparatus for microcopying. 
Mr. Pratt writes: 

> If certain rumors and actual 
    reports are to be considered authentic, there is an alarming disparity 
    in the use of films. Some are planning microcopies to be made on 16mm. 
    film; others upon 35mm. film, still 
    others upon widths not usually considered standard. The minifications 
    vary from 12 to 24. Some projectors and cameras now being designed 
    and readied for the market are adopting 35mm. film with the customary 
    double row of sprocket holes. Others, 
    with a view of salvaging more of the 
    available area, are planning on the 
    use of film on which but one row of 
    sprocket holes is punched. A camera 
    concern is developing a reading machine which uses no sprocket holes ....

> Furthermore, there is as yet 
    no standardization of titling, of
    separation of dockets, folios or pages. There is no uniformity of treatment in locating pages on the film---some photographing newspaper pages 
    vertically but book pages horizontally. Some are ignoring frame lines 
    and others attempting to squeeze a 
    certain number of pages into the definite standard film size. 
    
> Unless this situation is immediately controlled through action 
    of a standardization committee, this 
    lack of uniformity is going to cost 
    millions of dollars to correct. in 
    the early days of electric lamps each 
    manufacturer brought out his own 
    specifications of the base. The result was that electric lamps had to 
    be especially made to fit each manufacturer's sockets. No one has been 
    able to calculate the millions which 
    this foolish lack of standardization 
    cost. 
  
The problem of standardization 
brings to the fore the important fact that 
microcopying involves not only the manufac{%- include columnbreak.html canvas=301 col=2 -%}ture of the copies themselves, but also 

the distribution of reading equipment. The 
cheaper the reading equipment, the more 
easily will it be distributed to a number 
of scholars sufficient to render practical 
the large-scale utilization of microcopying 
in research. But at the same time, the reduction in the price of reading equipment 
means an increase in the cost of microcopies, because reading machines that will 
handle the high reduction ratios that go 
with low-cost micro-films will be more expensive than reading machines that handle 
only low reduction ratios. The manufacturing cost of reading equipment increases 
with the reduction ratio of the microcopy 
it is prepared to handle, and with the area 
of reading matter laid before the reader at 
a time. The *magnifying power*, *field of 
vision*, and the *light intensity* (which determines the amount of contrast in the projected image) are the three optical elements of the reading equipment which seem 
to have the controlling position in the determination of costs of equipment. There 
are other important points to be noted in 
reading equipment, such as ease of loading 
the film, or ease in passing from one page 
to another, but these can be ignored for 
the moment. They are independent of 
the choice of magnifying power, field of 
vision and light intensity. 

As soon as the cost of reading machines is introduced into the analysis of 
microcopy costs, the remarkable fact emerges that some of the fundamental elements of 
publishing accountancy are still present, 
but with the situations of the publisher 
and reader reversed. If a reader buys for 
$100 a reading machine which he uses to 
read 1,000 pages, he is paying $.10 a page 
for reading equipment; if he gets 100,000 
pages of reading matter, the cost per page 
of his reading equipment is only 1/10 of a 
cent. His reading machine is a "first 
cost," and the footage of film he acquires 
or uses in it a "running cost." If he cuts 
this first cost by purchasing a projector 
that will not handle microcopies of 23 diameters reduction, but will accept only microcopies of 9 or 12 diameters reduction, 
his running cost of reading matter will rise 
because he must pay more per page for the 
microcopies. If he cuts his first cost by
contenting himself with a machine that will 
show only a small area of projected image {% include pagebreak.html canvas=302 %} at a time, or give a lower light intensity, 
he may retain the low running cost of his 
reading matter, but must accept a sacrifice in the legibility factor. 

The situation may be clarified by 
an illustration taken from transportation. 
The railway (like publishing in printed 
form) imposes a heavy first cost in making 
every trip. But this cost per passenger 
will fall with the number of passengers, 
exactly as the cost per reader of printed 
books falls with the number of copies sold. 
The railway company makes the initial investment, the passenger pays only for what 
he uses, just as the publisher carries the 
initial cost and risk of publishing, and
the book buyer limits his investment to 
what he can actually use. The system will 
only be economically justifiable if a 
large number of people wish to go to the 
same place at the same time, just as publishing is only economically feasible if 
the saleable edition is large. 

The quantitative relationship between the *higher* cost of projectors to 
read film at high reduction ratios and the 
*lower* cost of the film itself is easily established from the calculations made above 
of the cost of microcopying the English 
books printed before 1640. Basing this 
calculation on the estimates of the cost 
to the libraries of film when forty libraries purchase copies, two quantities can 
be plotted against each other on a graph. 
On one axis is the cost differential between high power and low power projectors; 
on the other axis is the cost differential 
between high reduction and low reduction 
film. The figures for the film are expressed in thousands of pages, the figures 
for the projector in dollar differences between alternative reading machine prices. 
Every 30,000 pages will justify an expenditure of an additional $25.00 for a reading machine. 

The passenger has an alternative: 
he may buy a car. In that case he will 
have a fixed cost per mile for gas and oil, 
like the cost per page of books purchased 
in microcopy form. This cost will be constant, no matter how much he travels. He 
can go where he will, whether anyone else 
is going there at the same time or not, 
just as the microcopy reader can get any 
item in microcopy form, whether other readers want it or not. He is limited only by {% include columnbreak.html canvas=302 col=2 %}

the road network, as the reader of micro- 
copies is limited only by the resources of 
libraries offering microcopying service; 
and in this respect both car owner and microcopy reader are users of public property. And the microcopy, like the automobile, 
if used on a large scale, may change the 
whole design of a compartment of life. But 
the development of microcopying in lieu of, 
or as a supplement to, printed book publication, like the development of the automobile in its relation to railway travel, 
will attain its technological possibilities 
only to the degree that a wide market cuts 
the first cost of the reading equipment, 
the individual owners of it distribute this 
first cost over a large footage of film, land 
the libraries offer the services that render both of these conditions possible. 

This comparisom brings) to light at 
once the tremendous difficulty and the supreme importance of standardization at an 
early stage in the development of the new 
devices. Let us imagine, as a kind of a {% include pagebreak.html canvas=303 %} fantasy, that the automobile in its 
early stages had been some kind of a 
machine that required for its operation a special kind of road. Then let 
us suppose that in one part of the 
country roads were under construction 
that would serve for one make of automobile, while in another part of the 
country roads were built for another 
make of car, with road and automobile 
so related that the machine built to 
go on one road would not go on another! That is the kind of problem facing the intellectual world at this 
moment in the standardization of microcopying. Shall we build a projector that will read any microcopied 
film, whether card or film strip, 
whether broad or narrow, whether 
a high or low reduction ratio? Conceivably such projectors can be designed,  but will not their cost be so 
high that wide distribution will be forestalled? Or shall we have several makes 
of projector, each adapted to a particular 
kind of microcopy film, in which case the 
utility of each to the reader will be limited even though the price be less. Or 
shall libraries and others standardize 
their microcopying in such a way that one 
simple projector will serve for all purposes, in which case there is a risk that 
the chosen standard may not be the best, 
and almost a certainty that if it is well 
adapted to one type of material (as a long 
file of newspapers) it will be ill adapted 
to another type of material (as a short 
typescript monograph). 

There are at present too many unknowns to permit the solution of this intricate equation. But the facts and principles already set forth will serve at 
least to eliminate some of the unknowns, 
and to simplify in some measure the problem of standardization. 

## Essentials of Design for Reading Equipment: (a) Length of Line 

Into this labyrinth there are many 
approaches. The analysis might begin with 
estimates of buying power of various categories of institutions and readers; with 
estimates of the number of pages likely to 
be copied and hence the comparison of the 
relative importance to be attached to film 
prices and equipment prices; with a calcu{%- include columnbreak.html canvas=303 col=2 -%}lation of the probability that the essence 
of the matter lies in the short items on 
the one hand, long footages on the other; 
or with an anticipatory measurement of the 
proportions which various classes of reading matter, such as newspapers, books, manuscripts, etc., will hold in the corpus of microcopied material. But there is one 
seemingly trivial dimension which appears 
to the writer to occupy a crucial position
in determining policy, and that is the 
*length of the line* of print, typescript or 
manuscript. This unit, it has been noted, 
always bears some relation to size of print 
of type, and also to size of page. Bad 
typography or writing may make the line too 
long for the print, but there will always 
be some limits to the variation. Small 
type is almost invariably set in shorter 
lines than large type, and if a large page 
is to be used with small type, the type appears in the form of columns on the page. 
The resolving power of a photographic emulsion and process is exhibited in the reproduction of a *letter*, the labor cost of making an original negative microcopy is a 
quantity that varies with the number of 
*pages*, the processing costs of film vary 
with *footage*, but the technological meeting point of microcopying and microreading 
devices is found in the *line of reading matter*. 

Copying and reading devices are not 
incompatible though they differ greatly in 
the way in which they render the size of 
print or of page. A given piece of film, 
when put in one projector, may yield an 
image equivalent to 8-point type, in another projector an image equivalent to 
16-point type. The same film might show 
in one projector a spread of two pages laid 
before the reader's eye at once, in another 
projector one page only, and in a third 
projector only the upper half of a page. 
These differences would not render the 
projectors incompatible with each other, 
nor with the microcopying camera. But if 
a camera makes a microcopy in such dimensions that the projector will display from 
it an image that does not show full lines, 
the two are absolutely incompatible. 

Already there have appeared in the 
development of microcopying apparatus several outstanding examples of this incompatibility. The Recordak newspaper projector projects an image from a full frame of {% include pagebreak.html canvas=304 %} a l6mm. film or from one quarter of the 
"double frame" of a 35mm. film. A newspaper page, copied on the Eastman Recordak 
machine, is projected and read, a quarter-page at a time. There is no incompatibility here, for the quarter-page of the newspaper holds several columns, and no lines 
of reading are broken off in the middle. 
But the Library of Congress microcopies of 
manuscripts from foreign archives have 
been made to the number of over a million 
pages on 35mm. film, and most of them in 
the "first position" noted above, i.e., 
one page to a double frame, with the lines 
running full across the film. These film 
copies are incompatible with the Recordak 
projector. The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, acting on the advice of 
the writer, made copies of the Paris Peace 
Conference papers of Colonel House at the 
Yale University Library. These were copied 
in the same position as the Library of Congress documents from foreign archives, and 
are equally incompatible with the Recordak 
projector. The NRA hearings were copied 
on 16mm. film in the same position, i.e., 
with lines running full across the film, 
but since the full width of the film is only half the width of the 35mm. film, the 
Recordak projector will display a full page 
of the typescript, not cutting any lines. 

The present tentative design of a 
projection apparatus to be made by the International Filmbook Company seems to show 
that less than the full area of a book page 
is to be projected. About a dozen lines of 
print appear on the screen at a time. Then 
the film is moved to bring the remainder of 
the page into view. The projector is compatible only with film that has the lines 
running transversely across the film strip, 
as in positions 1 and 3---or indeed in 
the multiple arrangement suggested by Mr. 
Pratt. (see above.) To conform to this 
type of reading apparatus, Mr. Pratt recommends

> locating all pages vertically on the 
    film, with the lines of the printed 
    matter at right angles to the length 
    of the film. This will permit of simple projectors without revolving objective lenses and gates.

Another projector designed by the 
International Filmbook Corporation will {% include columnbreak.html canvas=304 col=2 %} permit the reading of lines running in either direction, and will expose a variable 
film area by substituting lenses and condensers. 

The Bibliofilm Service photographers, using the Draeger camera, copy their 
pages in the second position on 35mm. film. 
If they should copy in the first position, 
their film could not be read in a Recordak 
projector; the copies they are making in 
the second position cannot be read in the 
International Filmbook Teledex, but can be 
read in the International Filmbook Optigraph 
if the rolls are long enough; if they should 
copy in the third position their film would 
be readable in either the Recordak or Filmbook projector. 

## Essentials of Design for Reading Equipment. (b) The Page Rectangle 

Another given quantity, independent 
of any choice made by the designers of microcopying or reading equipment, is the 
general proportions of the normal page of 
reading matter. Ordinarily the page, whether of typescript, manuscript or print, sea 
rectangle of which the vertical dimension 
is greater than the horizontal by a factor 
of 25% to 50%. 8 1/2″ x 11″, 6″ x 9″, and 
other standard sizes from folio to duodecimo carry these proportions. The proportions are independent of the size of the 
page, and equally independent of reduction 
ratio in photographing or enlargement ratio 
in reading. They are related to length of 
line, because the line always corresponds 
to the short side of the page rectangle 
(except for pages set in more than one column). 

Taken in conjunction with two other 
fixed elements of the problem, namely, 
(1) the standardization of the width of the 
film and (2) the advantage of using the full 
area of the film the page rectangle, the 
proportions of the page rectangle become 
important determinants of design. This fact 
becomes especially noticeable when a fixed 
frame camera is used for copying. 

The ordinary moving picture frame 
on 35mm. film is a rectangle 1″ x 3/4″, 
with the long side across the film; the 
"double frame" used in the Leica, Contax, 
and Ludwig cameras exposes an area 1″ x 
1 3/8″, or 1″ x 1 1/2″, with the short side 
across the film. Edwards Brothers of Ann 
Arbor is prepared to furnish microcopies of {% include pagebreak.html canvas=305 %} European books made with a single frame 
camera; the equipment at Yale, New York 
Public Library, and Huntington Library, is 
of the double-frame type. With a single-frame camera, pages can be copied in the 
second or third position without loss of 
film area; with a double-frame camera pages can be copied in the first and second 
position without loss. But if a single-frame camera is used to copy pages in the 
first position, or a double-frame camera 
to copy them in the third position, from 
one-third to one-half of the area of the 
film is wasted. 

These considerations do not apply 
to copying cameras with changeable frames, 
but so much copying equipment is already 
set up with fixed frames, and especially 
with the fixed double frame, that any 
standardization of projectors that would 
force users of double-frame cameras to 
waste from one-third to one-half of their 
film in order to render their copying compatible with reading equipment would incur 
disadvantages in distribution. This fact, {% include columnbreak.html canvas=305 col=2 %} translated into terms of design, seems to 
call for projectors that can be adjusted to 
read lines of print that run across the 
film as well as lines that run along the 
film.

This element of the design of a 
projector is not a part of the optical system, but of the mechanical structure of the 
apparatus. 

So far as the optical system is 
concerned, the important fact to notice is 
that pages always appear as rectangles, of 
which the short side is the line of print. 
Two-page rectangles may be photographed on 
one film rectangle, but the initial proportions of the page rectangle will still control the proportions of the rectangle of 
film used in copying them. If the camera 
has a fixed frame area, either single-frame 
or double-frame, the proportions of the film 
rectangle are determined by the camera. But 
even if the camera is adjustable and can 
expose a larger or smaller length of film 
at a time, the proportions of the page will 
still control the proportions of the film

with the long side one-third to one-half 
longer than the short side. 

## Essentials of Design for Reading Equipment (c) the Aperture 

The aperture of a lens is usually 
measured as a diameter of the lens circle: 
but in connection with the problem of projecting pages it must be given another 
meaning. The aperture dimension that is 
effective for reading microcopied pages is 
the length of the long side of a rectangle 
with the proportions of a page (roughly 1″ 
x 1 1/2″), that can be inscribed in the 
lens circle. The word "aperture" as used 
below is a lens area *covering a rectangle 
of film measured along its long side*.[^n4] The 
aperture thus defined need not correspond 
in size to the page rectangle on the film, 
nor to the film rectangle which holds the 
image of one or two pages, nor the single 
frame or double frame that has its dimensions set by the camera. But in the ratio 
of its long side to its short side it will
still follow the general proportions of a 
page. The aperture is to the projector 
what the frame of film is to the camera. 

[^n4]: If the page rectangle is a multiple of 1″ x 1 1/2″---corresponding to the page size 6″ x 9″, the long 
side of the aperture rectangle (a) and the diameter of the lens circle (d) will always be so related 
that d = 1.2 x a. An aperture of 1″ goes with a lens diameter of 1.2″; an aperture of 1/2″ with a 
lens diameter of .6″, etc. 

It is possible to read a large 
frame of film with a small aperture if the 
film frame is moved in front of the aperture, so that the different parts are projected successively. This is true whether 
the frame of film has been used to copy 
one or two or even more pages. If the 
long side of an aperture equals the long 
side of a page rectangle, the page can be 
read without moving the film; if the long 
side of the aperture equals the short side 
of the page rectangle the page can be read 
by moving the film in front of the aperture; if the long side of the aperture is 
less than the short side of the page rectangle, the film and projector are incompatible, and the page cannot be read at 
all, (unless, indeed, the page happens to 
be set up on columns, and the long side of 
the aperture is equal to the width of the 
microcopied column). 

To consider an extreme case; two 
pages can be photographed (in the third position) on a single frame of film. One 
page of the original print will correspond {% include columnbreak.html canvas=306 col=2 %} to half a frame of film. Its long side  
will be 3/4″, its short side 1/2″; the 
length of line will be 1/2″. The aperture 
required for reading this film need be only 1/2″ (1/2″ x 3/8″) but in reading this 
film with a 1/2″ aperture, the film must be 
moved successively into four different positions: first, to read the top of the 
first page; then to read the bottom of the 
first page; then to read the top of the 
second page; and finally to read the bottom of the second page. An aperture of 1″ 
(1″ x 3/4″) would make it possible to read 
both pages without moving the film; an 
aperture of 1 1/2″ (1 1/2″ x 1″) would not 
only permit the reading of both pages at 
once but would also lay before the reader's 
eyes, at the same time, two frames of film, 
with four pages of reading matter. 

These principles are used in the 
Recordak newspaper projector. A newspaper 
is reduced sixteen diameters on 35mm. film. 
The aperture of the lens projects from the 
newspaper page rectangle (1″ x 1 1/2″) an 
area roughly 1/2″ x 3/4″. The film is 
moved in front of the aperture in such a 
way that the reader has before him at any 
time a projection of about a quarter of the 
newspaper page. Since the newspaper print 
is set in columns, this arrangement does 
not violate the principle that the aperture 
must be sufficient to exhibit the full 
length of a line. But in the case of the 
streamer headlines, running full across the 
newspaper page, this principle is violated, 
for the reader cannot have before his eye 
at one time a full streamer headline. This 
is an admitted inconvenience. It is overlooked in the Recordak design because a 
very small proportion of the reading matter 
of a newspaper consists of streamer headlines. 

The dimensions of length of line 
and the proportions of the page rectangle, 
when considered in connection with the 
standardized 35mm. and 16mm. film define 
certain specific dimensions in aperture as 
fixed alternatives in design. 

An aperture 1 1/2″ will display the 
long side of a page rectangle taken on a 
double frame of 35mm. film. An aperture 
of 1/2″ will display the short side of a 
page rectangle taken on 16mm. film. The {% include pagebreak.html canvas=307 %} intermediate steps in the series are show 
on the chart on the following page. 

These dimensions for aperture are 
final in the sense that there is no reason 
for building apparatus that will use an 
aperture intermediate between them. There 
is no use for an aperture of more than 
1 1/2″ for 35mm. film; there is no use in 
making the aperture larger than 3/4″ unless it is made a full inch; there is no 
stopping point between 1/2″ and 3/4″. An 
aperture of 5/8″ is wasteful; it can accomplish nothing that is not equally well 
accomplished with an aperture of 1/2″. 
These conclusions follow from the fact that 
the standard dimensions of the film and 
the normal proportions of a page rectangle 
are fixed quantities. 

## Essentials of Design for Reading Equipment: (d) the Enlargement Ratio 

With these apertures accepted as 
fixed alternatives for reading equipment, 
it remains not only to decide between them, 
but also to decide upon an enlargement ratio.

The enlargement ratio has only two 
fixed points that can be deduced from other fixed elements of the situation. It 
should hardly be less than six diameters, 
for then it would overlap the possibilities of direct optical magnifying by reading glass equipment. It is shown above 
that the cost of photosensitive surface on 
film is about four times that of the paper 
surface. If a 6″ x 9″ page is to be 
copied in the first position on 35mm. film, 
with a reduction of 6 diameters, it could 
be copied at no greater materials cost on 
paper in a reduction of 3 diameters. The 
paper copy, legible with a reading glass, 
would offer marked convenience in storage 
and filing. Equipment for making such paper copies is in sight. It would seem, 
therefore, that no enlargements of less 
than six diameters need be considered. Possibly the same argument in favor of paper 
could be extended to cover enlargements of 
eight or even of ten diameters, but for the 
moment it can be concluded that there is 
somewhere a minimum enlargement below which 
projection equipment is unnecessary, and 
this minimum is certainly six, and possibly 10 diameters. 

The upper limit of enlargement is 
dependent upon the range of the high reduc{%- include columnbreak.html canvas=307 col=2 -%}tion ratios. If they are set at 16 for 
newsprint and 24 for typescript, then the 
reading equipment will follow by disregarding the possibility of enlargement in a 
higher degree. If the reduction ratio 
should be pushed up---as some experimenters 
propose---to 40 diameters for typescript, 
the projector will have to follow it. These 
considerations fix the upper and lower limits for enlarging power in reading equipment. Between them there are no fixed stations. 

The enlargement ratio is, however, 
related in an important way to aperture. 
For instance, to take an extreme case, it 
is evident that a 1/4″ aperture in a machine that would make enlargements of only 
10 diameters would have a very restricted 
use; the octavo book pages or typescript 
pages that would have their length of line 
brought down to 1/4″ would have to pass 
through a reduction of 24 or more diameters. The projected image of such a microcopy, if enlarged only 10 diameters, would 
be less than half the original size and 
might therefore be illegible. On the other 
hand, a machine with a 1 1/2″ aperture set 
to make enlargements of 20 diameters, 
while it would be useful in projecting a 
full newspaper page at once, would be wasteful in projecting microcopied books that 
had passed through a reduction ratio of 20 
because it would show more pages than necessary, and would be equally wasteful in 
projecting book pages that had been enlarged only 10 diameters, because it would 
raise the size of the print to poster size. 

There is another and equally significant relationship between aperture and 
enlargement ratio. The cost of a lens and 
condenser system increases with the enlargement ratio, but diminishes with the aperture. Thus an optical system with large 
aperture and low enlargement ratio will 
cost the same as an optical system with 
small aperture and high enlargement ratio. 
If the present design of a certain reading 
equipment renders it too costly, the cost 
can be reduced by redesigning it either for 
smaller aperture or for lower enlarging 
power. If reading equipment at present 
available has insufficient enlarging power, 
the design can be altered to give a higher 
enlarging power without. altering the cost, 
but only by diminishing. the aperture. 

It might be argued that enlargement {% include pagebreak.html canvas=308 %}

 {% include pagebreak.html canvas=310 %} ratio can always be increased by bringing 
the lens nearer to the film, and setting 
the screen further from the lens. Thus a 
very cheap projector will make enlargements of 40 or more diameters by throwing 
an image on a distant wall. It does not 
follow, however, that a lens system devised to make enlargements of 10 diameters can be readjusted to make enlargements of 20 diameters, because the low 
power lens will not give the requisite 
definition, and the lighting system will 
not give the requisite contrast. The manufacturers of projectors will constantly 
be driven back to the alternative of sacrificing aperture for enlarging power, or 
enlarging power for aperture, or of sacrificing market if they standardize at a 
cost level that gives high enlarging power 
and large aperture. 

The terms of the equation to be solved by the industry are now set. It remains only to discover exactly which alternative aperture-enlargement combinations 
are available at various cost levels. What 
are the combinations of aperture and enlargement that can be sold for $40, for 
$60, for $100? The figures arranged 
above, showing the immense effect of the 
high reduction ratios in cutting the cost 
of film will exert a pressure toward the 
adoption of high enlarging power with 
small aperture. The argument for low enlarging power and large aperture will turn 
on several points, of which the most important probably are: 

1. That much equipment now in the hands of 
    scholars is of the double-frame type, 
    using 35mm. film, and with ordinary page 
    copying this operates at the lower reduction ratios.
2. That the high reduction ratios in microcopying require a degree of skill that 
    the scholar, an amateur in photography, 
    often cannot supply. He can safely 
    make mistakes in focusing, exposing, 
    and processing at 10 diameters of reduction, through the same errors would 
    be fatal if he were making reductions 
    of 20 diameters. 
3. That in short items made in unique 
    copies, labor cost is so high in proportion to materials cost that the price 
    advantages of high reduction ratios are 
    illusory. {% include columnbreak.html canvas=310 col=2 %} 
4. That the large-scale ventures in copying, such as the NRA and AAA code hearings, or the two million pages of early 
    English books, which make the high reduction ratios so advantageous, involve 
    the expenditure of such large sums that 
    they could sustain the manufacture of 
    special equipment for reading the films 
    made in such quantity. 
  
It is certain that there is a clear 
need for some reading equipment, such as 
the Recordak, that will handle reductions 
of 16 or more diameters by making enlargements of 16 to 20 diameters. Should all 
reading equipment be adapted to this use, 
or should there be an alternative line of 
projectors suited only to the reading of 
material copied in the zone of 10 diameters? If all reading equipment is to be 
adapted to the reading of material copied 
in the high reduction ratios, should it be 
designed to meet a low price level by sacrificing aperture? The analysis given 
above may clarify the problem and thus assist in its solution, but it cannot establish a proved answer. 

The four companies now most active 
in developing reading equipment are the 
Recordak Corporation, the Spencer Lens Company, the Folmer Graflex Company, the International Filmbook Corporation, and Dr. 
Draeger of the U. S. Navy. Leitz, Bausch 
and Lomb, and Spencer Lens have projectors 
that can be used for projection reading, 
though not specifically designed for it. 
Leitz has a combination enlarger and projector. The Graflex is working on a combination camera and projector. Spencer 
Lens Company and Dr. Draeger are using the 
single-frame aperture of one inch; the 
Recordak an aperture of 3/4″; the International Filmbook Corporation is trying to 
keep the cost of apparatus down by keeping 
the aperture small, while Dr. Draeger and 
the Spencer Lens Company are working to 
keep the price down by contenting themselves with a low reduction ratio. The librarians in general, and especially Mr. 
Metcalf of the New York Public Library, and 
the promoters of microcopying in Washington, 
especially Dr. Draeger and Dr. Watson Davis, 
are working with the Bureau of Standards 
and with other agencies toward standardization. The conclusion is not yet clear, but 
the observer must testify to the clear {% include pagebreak.html canvas=311 %} intelligence with which those working in 
the field have envisaged the difficulty of 
the problem of standardization and have undertaken to grapple with it. 

Conferences held in Washington, December 11 and 12, 1935, by various persons 
interested in the development of microcopying resulted in the following tentative 
proposals which were then circulated for 
review, and approved on behalf of the Joint 
Committee on Materials for Research by the 
Chairman and Executive Secretary. 

I 

There are three media of microcopying to be considered: paper, 35mm. film and 
16mm. film. Since the use of paper does 
not involve the need for a projector, it can 
be considered separately, but the great 
convenience in filing paper microcopies as 
compared with film, and the relative cheapness of paper as against film, indicate 
that paper must not be ignored in the microcopying problem. Dr. Bendikson of the 
Huntington Library, Dr. Dallas Irvine of 
the National Archives, and the Folmer 
Graflex Corporation in the development of 
their new copying camera are among those 
who have most carefully thought out the 
possibilities of microcopying on paper. 

II

Related to the distinction between 
the 16mm. and the 35mm. film, but not identical with the problem of the choice of 
film width, is the problem of reduction 
ratio on film for projection. 

The International Filmbook Corporation and the Recordak Corporation and the 
Recordak newspaper copying enterprises contemplate the use of 35mm. film with a high 
reduction ratio (16 to 23 diameters, or over). 
Such high reduction ratios are also to be 
used on the 16mm. film. Lower reduction ratios are developed by users of the Leica 
camera and by the Bibliofilm Service of the 
Department of Agriculture, which uses the 
Draeger camera, especially in connection 
with the microcopying of short items. Any 
reading equipment can easily be equipped 
with reel-holding devices that will take 
either 16mm. or 35mm. film, and it should 
be a rule that designers are not encouraged 
to develop apparatus that will not permit 
the use of either width of film. In connection with the problem of enlargement 
ratio, a different situation exists. 

 {% include columnbreak.html canvas=311 col=2 %} 

III

Projecting equipment, granted that 
it is adapted to both 16mm. and 35mm. film, 
will vary in the following essential particulars:

a. It may be fixed focus or variable focus. 
The Recordak equipment has a fixed enlarging ratio of 22 diameters. The projective Folmer Graflex equipment will 
have a varying enlargement ratio that 
can be set at will. Each of these methods has its advantages and disadvantages. 

b. Some reading equipment throws the image 
on a screen from which it is reflected 
back to the eye; other equipment throws 
the image through a semi-translucent 
screen. The Recordak and Folmer Graflex 
will be of the first type. The translucent reading machines will be the International Filmbook apparatus, the Draeger 
projection reader, and possibly the machine put on sale by the Leitz Company, 
and possibly the machine to be developed 
by the Spencer Lens Company. 

c. Reading machines differ in the size of 
aperture; that is to say, in the amount 
of film they will enlarge for reading at 
one time. The Leica projector takes a 
double frame of 35mm, film, 1″ x 1 1/2″. 
The aperture of the Spencer Lens Company 
projector now contemplated will be a single frame, 3/4″ 1″; that of the Recordak 
is one-quarter of a frame; and that of 
the International Filmbook Corporation 
may be even less. In general, there is a 
relationship between size of aperture 
and enlargement power, because if the 
aperture is only one-quarter of a frame 
it will not permit the reading of lines 
of print that have been microcopied to extend across the full width of 35mm. film. 

IV 

Material that has been microcopied 
on 16mm. film at a high reduction ratio can 
be printed off on 35mm. film at a lower reduction ratio; material that has been microcopied on 35mm. film at a low reduction 
ratio can be copied off on 16mm. film at a 
high reduction ratio. This fact is of vital importance because it permits the purchaser of a low power projecting apparatus 
to order copies of any long run of 16mm., 
high reduction ratio film (as the NRA and 
AAA records) in a form that he can read. 
Conversely, the purchaser of a small {% include pagebreak.html canvas=312 %} aperture, high reduction ratio projector 
can utilize material that was originally 
copied with a low reduction ratio on 35mm. 
film, if he has it printed off on the reduced size. 

V 

Taking into account the foregoing 
facts and possibilities, it would appear 
that the following developments in projection apparatus can be integrated into a 
common system and so arranged that the 
products of any microcopying enterprise 
could be made available to the projectors 
of any apparatus, with a few exceptions 
that will be noted: 

a. Double frame aperture, low enlarging 
power---Leica (now available but costly). 

b. Single-frame aperture, fixed focus, 12 
diameter enlarging power, reading by 
transmitted light---under development by 
Dr. Draeger. 

c. One-half frame aperture, 22 diameter enlarging power, fixed focus, reading by 
reflected light---Recordak apparatus. 

d. Variable aperture, variable enlarging 
power, reading by reflected light---Folmer Graflex machine. 

e. One-quarter frame aperture, very high 
enlarging power, fixed focus, transmitted light---International Filmbook 
Corporation development. 

VI 

Large-scale copying enterprises, 
such as the proposed microcopying of books 
published prior to 1640, can be made on 
either 35mm. or 16mm. film, either at a 
high reduction ratio (as 16, 20, 23) or a 
low reduction ratio (as 9 to 14 diameters). 
If the master copy is made in a low reduction ratio, the possessors of Recordak or 
International Filmbook apparatus would 
merely purchase their film in a reduction 
on 16mm. film. If the original is made at 
a high reduction ratio on 16mm. film, the 
possessors of the Draeger, Leica, and presumably Folmer Graflex apparatus would purchase it in the enlarged form on 35mm. 
film. The newspaper material now being 
copied by the Recordak Corporation in a 
reduction of 16 diameters can be read presumably on any one of four reading ma{%- include columnbreak.html canvas=312 col=2 -%}chines: the Draeger projector will enlarge it back 14 diameters, at some loss of 
legibility, but it will show the full 
width of the newspaper page; the Recordak 
projector will show only one-quarter of a 
page, but enlarge it above original size; 
the International Filmbook machines will 
presumably show less than one-quarter of 
the area of the newspaper page, but may 
give it even more enlargement than the 
Recordak; Folmer Graflex can presumably be 
adapted to the reading of this type of 
film. Microcopies produced like the NRA 
and AAA series can be read presumably directly and without change on the Recordak, 
International Filmbook and Folmer Graflex 
equipment. For reading on the Draeger, 
Leica and Spencer Lens projectors, they 
would be reproduced for the purchaser in 
35mm. width, making the reduction equivalent to 11 1/2 diameters rather than 23
diameters. The short strips of film now 
being distributed by the Bibliofilm Service in reductions of 9 or 10 diameters can 
presumably be read on all projection apparatus except that of the International Filmbook Corporation, and doubtless if special 
instructions are given for the filming of 
such strips by the Bibliofilm Service they 
can be adapted even to the International 
Filmbook projector. 

VII 

Conclusion: it is submitted that 
this array of equipment will provide for
the reading of any film now being used, or 
likely to be used, with present: techniques, 
except such copies made at very high reduction on multiple exposure on 35mm. film. 
Such copies would be legible only in the 
Recordak and International Filmbook apparatus.

## Film Storage and Durability 

To the extent that microphotography 
is used merely as a substitute for interlibrary lending, the question of the permanence of the film is not important. There 
is no doubt that its stability is sufficient for a span of years in which a scholar is carrying out a specific research 
project. His collection of material, in 
microcopy form, will not go to pieces on 
his hands.

But if microcopying is to take the {% include pagebreak.html canvas=313 %} place of publication, or if libraries are 
to alter their general acquisition policies 
to give a large place to film instead of 
paper, the fundamental question of durability of film must be met. "Dr. A. F. 
Kuhlman, in an article on the preservation 
of newspapers on film, has stated the issue comprehensively: 

> Before we are ready to preserve newspapers in film form, dependable and 
favorable answers must be found to a 
series of unsolved problems. First, 
the Bureau of Standards must settle 
the question of the life expectancy 
of the film record, The Bureau must 
determine: (1) the chemical and 
physical properties of the cellulose 
acetate film and of the emulsion and 
image produced upon it in filming records; (2) specifications for producing and processing the film to obtain 
the most usable and durable production; (3) the effect upon the film 
copy, while in use or storage, of various environmental conditions---temperature, humidity, light, human contact, etc.; and (4) specifications 
for storage and use. These points 
determined, it should be possible to 
predict, on the strength of verified 
data, the life expectancy of the film 
if produced, processed, stored and 
used under clearly specified conditions."[^n5] 

[^n5]: A. F. Kuhlman:  "Are We Ready to Preserve Newspapers on Films? A Symposium." *The Library Quarterly*, 
V, April, 1935, pp. 212--213. 

The Carnegie Foundation has made a 
grant of $5,000.00 to the Bureau of Standards to study film durability, and the research was under way in the year 1935. 
The research had progressed sufficiently 
by January, 1936 to warrant the conclusion 
that cellulose acetate film, properly 
processed, offers a satisfactory prospect 
of durability. 

Moreover, the extraordinary evidence on durability that comes to light 
with the preservation of microcopied material from the siege of Paris must not be 
ignored. The reduction ratio, it has been 
established, was 32 to 39 diameters from 
newsprint. The film was probably a nitrate 
collodion base, less durable in all probability than the acetate safety film. This {% include columnbreak.html canvas=313 col=2 %} discussion of durability has been based on 
the assumption that photographers will use 
a film base more durable, and a reduction 
ratio less exacting, than that which has 
survived for 65 years from the siege of 
Paris. 

Correspondence with film manufacturers and motion picture engineers is inconclusive in establishing rules for the 
storage of safety film. Some advice special measures to insure controlled conditions of humidity and temperature. All are 
agreed that there is no special fire risk 
in the case of safety film. The Recordak 
Corporation does not recommend any special 
control of atmospheric conditions in the 
storage of film. The Bureau of Standards 
reports a probability that film will dry 
out if stored in atmospheres of deficient 
relative humidity, but dried film can be 
reconditioned and restored. The practical 
plan that was agreed upon as satisfactory 
at the Richmond meeting of a group interested in microcopying (May, 1936) is to 
store film in a metal cabinet, keep a cheap 
hair hydrometer in the cabinet, and maintain humidity by putting a sponge in the 
cabinet if it gets too dry. The storage 
of film will not impose upon librarians any 
significant special expenses. 

Assuming the permanence of film and 
the suitability of ordinary storage space 
for its preservation, the microcopying of 
documents for the sake of preserving them 
will be paid for by savings in storage 
space under certain conditions. Figures 
prepared by the Recordak Corporation indicate that it will pay to microcopy documents 
that are to be retained for fifty years if 
storage space costs are more than $.014 per 
cubic foot per year, and if storage space 
costs $.028 per cubic foot per year it will 
pay to microcopy documents that are to be 
retained for only twenty-five years. The 
costs of Recordak copying are less than the 
costs of the filing cabinets required to 
hold the original material. The microcopying fixes all the documents in an unbreakable series. This is an advantage as a 
protection against loss of individual documents through theft or carelessness; it is 
a disadvantage if a file is still active in 
the sense that new material ought to be interspersed between material already filed. {% include pagebreak.html canvas=313 %} Since library space costs $.40 to $.50 a 
cubic foot for construction (see Chapter 
II), and gives rise to further costs for 
lighting and heating, it would appear that 
the interest charges and maintenance costs 
of library space would pay for transferring 
material from paper to film. It does not 
follow from this fact that such a transfer 
of material is desirable, but only that it 
is economically feasible. The reduction 
ratio in microcopying that would bring 
about this cost relationship is of course 
a high one---sixteen to twenty-three diameters.[^n6]
 
[^n6]: COMPARISON OF COST OF OBTAINING AND STORING FILM COPIES OF MATERIALS WITH STORAGE COSTS OF THE ORIGINAL MATERIALS 

    Document size 8 1/2″ x 11″ (letter size). 
    
    A standard file drawer holds approximately 3,500 letter size sheets and a four-drawer file cabinet about 14,000 sheets. A four-drawer cabinet is 15″ wide 30″ deep and 51″ high. It consequently occupies 13 3/10 cubic feet of space without considering the aisle space required. 
    
    Using a Recordak working at a 23-1 reduction 2,352 of the above documents can be photographed on a 100-foot roll of Recordak film. This roll of film costs $2.75 including development. 
    
    Fourteen-thousand 8 1/2″ x 11″ documents will require slightly under six 100-foot rolls of Recordak Film, 
    
    These will occupy 104 cubic inches or 6/100 of a cubic foot of space. 
    
    These will cost $16.50. 
    
    It is entirely practical to photograph 50 letter size documents per minute with the Commercial Recordak. Consequently, to photograph 14,000 of these documents will require about 4-2/3 hours. At $.40 per hour, the labor cost of photographing 14,000 documents will be $1.87. 
    
    \* \* \* \* \*
    
    Using the above figures as a basis: 
    
    13.5 cu. ft.-.06 cu. ft. = 13.24 cu. ft., which is the space saved by photographing the documents. 
    
    The film and developing cost plus the labor cost is $16.50 ÷ $1.87 = $18.37, which is the cost of obtaining the film copy. 
    
    If the documents are retained for fifty years it will pay to Recordak them if storage space costs more than $.0278 per cubic foot per year. 
    
    $18.37 ÷ 50 = $.3674 
    
    $.3674 \[÷\] 13.24 = $.0278 
    
    If the documents are retained for twenty-five years it will pay to Recordak them if storage space costs more than $.0555 per cubic foot per year. 
    
    \* \* \* \* \*
    
    No allowance has been made in the above comparison for the aisle space required by the document files. Since at least 50% of the room space is required for aisles, this should be taken into consideration. We can consequently say that: 
    
    If the documents are retained for fifty years, it will pay to Recordak them if storage space costs more than $.0139 per cubic foot per year. 
    
    If the documents are retained for twenty-five years it will pay to Recordak them if storage space costs more than $.0278 per cubic foot per year. 
  
The four methods in use for the 
storage of film are: (a) storage in cans; 
(b) storage on reels; (c) storage in a 
cartridge; (d) storage in partitioned boxes. The cans, such as those sold by the 
Jam Handy Company of Chicago at $3.00 per {% include columnbreak.html canvas=324 col=2 %} 100, are small tin pill boxes. They keep 
each short length of film in place, but 
they offer no protection to the ends, edges 
or surface of the film. The reels provided 
by the Recordak Corporation are suitable 
for long' strips, just' as the pill boxes are 
for the small strips; they protect sides 
and surface. The International Filmbook 
Corporation has a foolproof cartridge that 
can be inserted in the projection reading 
machine; it protects ends, sides and surfaces. The Leitz Company sells small metal boxes divided into twenty-five chambers 
each of which holds a five-foot roll of 
Leica film. 

The preservation of the film involves not only the intrinsic stability of 
base and emulsion, but also requires special care in the processing, to the end {% include pagebreak.html canvas=315 %} that no traces of the developing or fixing 
solutions remain on the film; and it may 
call for the protection of the surface 
from abrasion in use. It is a question 
whether the film surface should not be 
given a special hardening treatment to 
protect it from abrasion. The International Filmbook Corporation claims that 
its projection apparatus is devised to prevent abrasion; the film is not in contact 
with glass while it is in focus in the 
projector. 

If the cellulose acetate film base 
and emulsion should ever prove to be insufficiently stable, there is a chance 
that a microphotographic image on aluminum 
could be used. The firm of Siemens and 
Halske has developed a process which, as 
nearly as the writer can gather from available information, puts a photographic image 
on metal without a gelatine emulsion. The 
light, sensitive substance is an inorganic 
colloid, aluminum oxide. This is the "Seo 
Process." Negotiations for its introduction in America are under way. 

## Microcopying of Newspapers[^n7]

[^n7]: The reader is referred again to the interesting symposium published by Dr. A. F. Kuhlman in *The Library Quarterly*, V, (1935) pp. 189-214. "Are We Ready to Preserve Newspapers on Film?" 

The use of microcopying in the 
preservation of newspaper files is of special interest to librarians for several 
reasons. 

a. The library's investment in 
storage space is greater in the case of 
newspapers than in the case of books. 

b. Newspapers printed since 1880 are 
perishable. Mechanical wood pulp paper 
began to be used about that time. A few 
newspapers today publish a special edition 
on permanent paper, and several suggested 
processes are in the field for preserving 
the wood pulp medium. The most tested 
process is that of the New York Public Library; a sheet of transparent Japanese 
tissue paper is pasted with rice paste 
over both sides of each sheet of newsprint. 
The cost of this process is $.04 a page. 

c. There is no market supply of 
old newspaper files. Acquisition possibilities as well as prices of old files are a 
matter of accident. A library cannot plan 
an equipment of newspaper files with any 
assurance that it will be able to complete 
its plan.

From another point of view, newspapers would seem to be among the least {% include columnbreak.html canvas=315 col=2 %} suited for microcopying, because the price 
of original files of newspapers is low in 
terms of printed area of page. In copying 
the NRA records, for instance, microcopying distributed the copies at $.12 per 100 
pages, when the only alternative was hectographing or mimeographing at $2.00 per 100 
pages. The Recordak Corporation and the 
New York Times Company have arranged the 
microcopying of nearly 90,000 pages of the 
New York *Times* for the five years 1914--1918 inclusive. The positive copies of 
this file are offered to purchasers at $.66 
per 100 pages. Since the bare subscription 
price of a year of the *Times* is only $18.00, 
or $.10 per 100 pages, it would seem at 
first glance that microcopying must be more 
expensive than original purchase. 

| | NRA and AAA hearings | New York *Times* |
|-----|-----:|-----:|
| Price on paper | $2.00 | $.10 | 
| Price on film | .12 |.66 |

In both cases the cost of binding and storage must be added to the price of the paper 
copies, and the cost of a projector or projectors financed into the cost of the film 
copies. But when considerations of *storage*, 
*perishability*, and *availibility* are taken 
into account, the case for microcopying of 
newspapers is much better than the above 
figures would suggest. 

A comparison of the different prices at which newspaper files may be preserved brings into a comparative scale the 
three alternatives now confronting libraries, namely: 

1. Preservation by purchase and storage of 
    original files which may be on perishable paper in most cases, on permanent paper in a few cases. 
2. Preservation by photo-offset in a reduced scale on permanent paper. 
3. Preservation by microcopying on film. 

The figures on microcopying in 
items 17, 18, and 19 below do not take into account the important factor of "first 
cost" in making the original negative film. 
The Recordak project is financed on a risk 
basis like ordinary book publishing. Early 
estimates of the cost of the first negative set this cost figure at $.10 a foot,

cost of this negative is of course distributed among the subscribers to the sets 
of film, who buy their positive sets at 
$120.00. The price of the processing is 
set at a figure well below the maximum for 
this kind of work, and the project has 
been set on foot in such a way that the 
sponsors take the risk that they may not 
sell enough positive copies to distribute 
their "first cost,™ and to expect, to gain 
a profit if the number of buyers more {% include columnbreak.html canvas=316 col=2 %} than distributes this first cost. It is 
probable that in this instance the actual 
first cost is much in excess of $.10 a foot 
because of the labor of collating the file. 
A special condition that confronts 
those who would microcopy newspaper pages 
is set by the state of present equipment. 
The newspaper Recordak copies loose pages 
only. Each page of the newspaper is 
passed through the machine, first on one 
side, then on the other. In this way {% include pagebreak.html canvas=317 %} newspaper pages can be copied in sequence 
in the "first position" on the film, in a 
reduction of 16 diameters. If bound newspaper files are to be microcopied without 
disturbing the binding, two obstacles would 
have to be met. First, the binding of the 
papers often leaves the inner column obscured because of the thickness of the volume and the narrowness of the binding margin. Second, a great amount of moving of 
the newspaper would be necessary if it were 
to be copied in the "first position" on the 
film. The camera would first take page 
one, then the whole bound newspaper volume 
would have to be moved the full width of a 
page to permit the copying of page two, 
then back again for page three, etc. If 
the bound newspaper volumes were to be copied in the "second position," the reduction 
ratio would be greater because the whole 
height of the newspaper---22″ in the case of 
the New York *Times*---would have to go on the 
same width of film that otherwise takes 
18″, The New York *Times* microcopied in the 
first position is reduced only 16 diameters, in the second position it would have 
to be reduced 20 diameters. 

There are some newspapers with 
larger sheets than the New York *Times*, and 
some with smaller print. This is especially true of old files. The experts of the 
Recordak Corporation testify that even 
these pages can be handled on 35mm. film, 
but some interested persons---notably Dr. 
Thomas Martin of the Library of Congress---feel that it is safer to count on using 
70mm. film for particularly difficult copying operations. The newspaper file may be 
"bad copy" not only because of the large 
size of the page or the small size of the 
type, but also because of blurring or discoloration. Some of the Russian newspapers from the years of the Revolution, now 
stored in the Hoover War Library, are almost illegible in their present form because of this blurring of ink on a very 
poor quality of paper. However, with the 
example of M. Dagron and his microcopies 
in 32-39 diameters of reduction preserved 
from the year 1870, the technicians can 
probably be trusted to solve the micro- 
copying of bad copy without breaking too 
far from the cost levels indicated by the 
experiment with the New York *Times*. 

Another important element in the 
question of microcopying has to do with {% include columnbreak.html canvas=317 col=2 %} the attitude of the readers and research 
workers toward this form. In 1934 the New 
York Public Library did a great service to 
scholarship by utilizing microcopies of 
current months of the New York *Times* in its 
newspaper reading room. The weight of opinion on the part of the readers was favorable to the use of films in preference to 
the newspapers themselves, largely because 
of the greater convenience in handling. The 
experiment was sufficient to justify the 
conclusion that readers will accept microcopied newspapers in lieu of the original 
files. The new reading equipment being devised will increase the advantage of the 
process, because it will make it possible 
for a reader to make his own photostatic 
copy of a part of a newspaper page whenever 
he wishes. This will reduce the cost of 
photostat copies of parts of newspapers to 
a materials plus processing cost, for it 
will make the reader his own photographer, 
eliminating expensive labor in the photostat room. 

The present state of our knowledge 
regarding the advisability of depending on 
microcopying for the collection and preservation of newspapers can be summarized in 
a few statements: 

1. No library should at present embark on a large scale plan for the purchase, binding and storage of newspaper files without taking into account the revolutionary implications of microcopying. 
2. If, as now seems probable, an increasing number of newspapers offer their current issues to libraries in microcopy form at a reasonable price, the chances are all in favor of preferring the microcopies to a wood pulp paper edition on grounds of permanence. 

## Microcopying and Library Cataloguing 

Another special use of the microcopying process can be found in the copying 
of library catalogues. It has been stated 
above that the leading library problem of 
the present lies in the field of interlibrary coordination. It was the service of the 
last generation of librarians to bring the 
technique of collecting, accessioning, and 
cataloguing books to such a high point that 
a great library becomes in effect a running 
index, constantly brought up to date, of 
the world's knowledge. But as the demands {% include pagebreak.html canvas=318 %} of scholarship increase beyond the powers 
of any library to supply them, the logical 
unit for the next stage in organization becomes the interlibrary system. 

One of the instruments of interlibrary cooperation is undoubtedly the union 
catalogue. The largest project of this 
kind is "Project B" of the Library of Congress, under the direction of Mr. Ernest 
Kletsch. The Library of Congress is filing in a great filing system the author 
cards of the holdings of all American libraries, especially the holdings of rare 
books. Already eight million cards are 
filed. But another use of the union list 
is in the field of library coöperation. If 
the libraries of a given region can centralize information about their holdings, 
they can not only save the scholar a great 
deal of time in discovering whether or not 
a given title is accessible, but they can 
make their accession money go further by 
avoiding unnecessary duplication in purchasing. 

The need for "white collar projects" under the Works Projects Administration in 1935 led to the development of a 
technique for using microcopying in the 
preparation of a union list. Projects 
drawn up and submitted to Public Works 
authorities in the autumn of 1935 in Cleveland and in Philadelphia provided for the 
microcopying of all card catalogues of the 
libraries of each of these regions. The 
making of the cards for the union catalogue 
was then to be given to an army of typists, 
who would read the film copies of the catalogues. The reasons for copying indirectly, through film, rather than directly 
from the card catalogues of the participating libraries were, first, that the film 
copy could be made quickly, by one operator, using one drawer of cards at a time, 
and thus without disorganizing the functioning of a catalogue room; and second, 
that the typing and checking operations 
could be centralized in one room, with adequate supervision. Of course the cards 
would be more accurately and quickly copied if the film were enlarged by the available automatic enlarging machines to 3″ x 
5″ card size, but the importance of using 
as large a proportion as possible of Works 
Progress Administration money for wages 
made it necessary to resort to typing. 

However, a better technique for {% include columnbreak.html canvas=318 col=2 %} using microcopying in the compilation of 
union lists was worked out by Dr. T. R. 
Schellenberg and Mr. Paul Vanderbilt in 
connection with the Philadelphia union list 
project. They proposed to microcopy a catalogue, compare the microcopy film with a 
foundation catalogue of Library of Congress 
cards, designate the holdings indicated on 
the film copy by marking the Library of 
Congress card whenever the title was already present in the foundation catalogue, 
and punch the film whenever there was no 
card present in the foundation catalogue. 
The Recordak Corporation machinery would 
then pick out automatically and reproduce 
photographically on 3″ x 5″ cards the film 
items that were punched for reproduction. 

Under some circumstances it may be 
advisable to reproduce a whole library catalogue on cards. Three photographic techniques are available for this purpose. A 
number of cards can be laid out on a flat 
surface and copied on a large sheet of 
photostat paper with the ordinary photostat 
machine. The sheet can then be cut up into 3″ x 5″ cards, and the cards filed. Or, 
the Dexigraph or photostat can be used to 
reproduce the cards one by one on 3″ x 5″ 
cards of photostat paper. This is the 
process used by the Library of Congress in 
its Project B; it was also used by Yale 
University Library in duplicating its 
great catalogue for internal administrative 
purposes. Then the Recordak Corporation 
can take a 16mm. microcopy of a card catalogue and enlarge it automatically on 3″ x 
5″ cards. The photostat and Dexigraph 
methods yield a negative (white on black) 
card; the Recordak method a positive (black 
on white) card. The costs run from $20,000 
to $30,000 per million cards. 

There is a possible substitute for 
a union catalogue that may make its way in 
the future in library administration. A 
great card catalogue may be copied on the 
16mm. film, and the catalogue itself held 
by another library for reference and checking purposes. A group of such catalogues 
might be called an "assembled catalogue" 
rather than a union catalogue. The cards 
would be consulted in the reading machine, 
like any other microcopied material. The 
cost of making a microcopy of a card catalogue, for this kind of use, would be only 
$500.00 per million cards, including labor 
costs. While it would be less useful than {% include pagebreak.html canvas=319 %} a union list in one respect---one would have 
to consult each library catalogue separately to determine whether or not a given book 
were available---it would in another way offer an advantage over the ordinary union 
list, for the whole subject entry classifications of a library catalogue would be reproduced. If, for instance, the film copy 
of the catalogues of the Library of Congress, the New York Public Library, and the 
Widener Library of Harvard University were 
on the floor of Columbia University Library, 
a scholar could check up quickly the holdings that each of these libraries had catalogued under a given subject head. This 
kind of use could not even be made of the 
great Project B union catalogue. The place 
of the "assembled catalogue" in library administration is untested. Another weakness 
in the use of the microcopy of a library 
catalogue as a basis for the organization 
of interlibrary coöperation is the impossibility of filing new entries between old 
ones. Perhaps the idea will prove most 
serviceable if it is combined with the 
union list idea. Libraries might procure 
microcopies of each other's catalogues, and 
then arrange for the exchange of catalogue 
cards on certain classes of future entries, 
or supplement the "assembled catalogue" (a 
number of copies of separate library catalogues assembled in one room), with a true 
union list of current acquisitions, made 
by filing one card for each new title acquired by each of the coöperating institutions. 

## Photography as the Scholar's Amanuensis 

The analysis of costs and problems 
in the preceding pages has been devoted 
principally to the place of microphotography as a part of a library system. But 
the technique offers a variety of adaptations to the needs of individual scholars 
who may do their own work. Some scholars 
will find it useful to possess a camera 
that can be used for pictorial and document 
photography alike. For them the Leica or 
Contax, with its numerous accessory fixtures, is the best implement for microcopying. The selection of pages for copying and the copying itself are merged as 
one operation, so that labor costs in photographing do not appear; the photographing is part of the research. The scholars 
who have taken microcopies of documents {% include columnbreak.html canvas=319 col=2 %} 
have often found it necessary afterwards 
to enlarge them on photostat paper. If 
the material is such that enlargements will 
be necessary, a step can be saved by making 
the original photograph on a narrow strip 
of photostat paper in the Graflex camera, 
soon to be placed on the market. Or again, 
reflection copying without a camera may facilitate the gathering of records by a 
scholar. 

Just as the scholars of the last 
generation found in general that it was 
desirable to be able to use the typewriter, 
so the scholars of the next generation 
will find it necessary to use photography. 
Just as each scholar works out his own note 
system, combining typescript and longhand 
notes, so the scholar of the future will 
make his combinations of typescript, longhand, photographs on paper, and photographs 
on film. Microcopying, as a technique in 
the hands of a man who does his own work of 
photographing and processing, is reduced 
to its bare materials costs. It offers the 
possibility that a scholar, by purchasing 
microcopies from libraries and by making 
his own microcopies of excerpts from books, 
may build up organized accumulations of 
data that will resemble a private library 
in extensiveness, and a note system in its 
internal organization. Pictorial and textual material can be fitted into the same 
file. That which scholars in the past have 
been able to do with the help of an amanuensis, the scholar of the future may be 
able to accomplish with photographic equipment. 

It is possible that the development 
of this use of photography---whether on paper or film---will have an effect upon the 
intellectual standards of scholarship, for 
the technique will automatically tend to 
distinguish between that kind of intellectual labor that is merely the gathering together of documents and that which is the 
creative analysis of evidence, 

## The Merging of Collecting and Publishing 

An even more sweeping change in 
the pattern of intellectual organization is 
to be anticipated from the full development 
of the possibilities of microphotography. 
The change that can be expected is one that, 
in a way, would restore a condition that 
passed out of existence with the invention 
of printing. For it was the technique and {% include pagebreak.html canvas=320 col=2 %} accountancy of printing that created the 
sharp distinction between the operations 
of collecting material and publishing. In
the days of the manuscript, copies of a 
book were made to order for a collector; a 
possessor of a book was in a position to 
have it copied when a copy of it was desired. There was hardly any distinction 
between "published" and "unpublished" material. If a monastery maintained a 
scriptorium, and if its policy was to accede to requests for copies of its books, 
its whole library was, in a sense, "published" material. 

Precisely this situation returns 
to the degree that microcopying becomes 
generally available. A library with a collection of theatre programs, or pamphlets 
of the revolutionary war, or historical 
manuscripts may adopt the policy of making 
microcopies of its materials upon request. 
If it adopts this policy, its whole collection becomes available to the world as 
if published. If the policy becomes widespread, so that one institution can expect 
to have its requests honored at other institutions, its collection can be perfected and rounded out according to a logical scheme. In that way, the making of a 
collection comes to resemble more nearly 
the preparation of a work of scholarship 
than a mere mercantile operation in the 
book market. Before the eyes of scholarship there looms a new unit of intellectual activity---the making of collections 
which will be "complete" within their predetermined limits to a degree that has 
been hitherto impossible. And this new 
unit, the collection, ceases to be functionally distinct from a publication. 

The more clearly this merging of 
collecting with publishing is achieved, 
the greater will be the place that scholarship must give to the bibliographical and 
abstracting services that will guide the 
research worker through the embarrassing 
array of materials that will become accessible to him. The fact that a given item 
is printed as a book has hitherto served 
to give it recognition in bibliographical 
guides from which unprinted items are ex{%- include columnbreak.html canvas=320 col=2 -%}cluded. If this mechanical basis of distinction loses its significance, the emphasis upon intellectual bases of distinction must be greater than ever. 

Some librarians have raised the 
question whether it would not be wise to 
make up special bibliographies of microcopies that are available. The problem 
they raise is important, but it leads beyond the point they have in mind. If a library has installed apparatus for microcopying and is willing to microphotograph its 
holdings on request, does not its entire 
holding become, in effect, available as microcopied material? If manuscript material 
is microcopied in Europe and brought to 
America, it becomes a new item, a new resource of American scholarship. But the 
same is true of a body of American manuscripts that may be discovered in an attic 
and deposited in a library that offers microcopying service. It is premature at 
this stage to do more than suggest how wide 
the new fields are in the science of librarianship that are now open for exploration. 
There is however, one conclusion that can 
be drawn, even in the present state of the 
technique. This conclusion is that we may 
expect that the future will make the small 
libraries more important than they have 
hitherto been: in the intellectual organization of the country. They will be able, 
not only to draw more freely upon the large 
libraries in the service of their scholars, 
but also to shoulder their share of the 
burden of maintaining the great archive of 
our civilization. Each unit in the vast 
library system can perform a task that will 
be proportionate to its resources, and yet 
fitted into the general scheme in a unique 
and useful way. The library may come to 
be, not only a depository of printed material, not only a collector of existing records, but even a maker of new records. It 
may come to be a part of the function of 
the library of the future to reduce to 
writing information that would otherwise 
go unrecorded. There is no community so 
small that it does not offer to a sensitive 
mind aspects of human life that are worthy 
of record, and facts that should be entered in the dossiers of scholarship.
