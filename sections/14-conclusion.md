{% include pagebreak.html canvas=353 %}Since the first edition of this 
manual was issued in 1931, the whole scene 
has been changed by technological developments. Predictions of that time have been 
realized in the actual appearance, not 
alone of new apparatus, but of enterprises 
on a large scale committed to the development of microphotography in scholarly documentation. It has seemed almost impossible 
to close the book, because the rush of innovation makes a chapter out of date almost 
as soon as it leaves the typist's hands. 
Even at this writing, information of future 
developments that may overturn some of the 
cost tables is in hand, though it cannot at 
this time be published. 

Nevertheless, from this study there 
emerge certain general principles that seem 
to have constant application. If these 
principles are rightly understood, they can 
easily be applied to the new techniques and 
cost situations as they arise. Foremost 
among these principles is the importance of 
breaking away from the standards that are 
deduced from the technique and costs of ordinary publishing in print, and of viewing 
the whole problem of preservation and distribution of the records of civilization 
and the materials of scholarship in terms 
of a variety of techniques. The point of 
view must be functional, and the functions 
of technics in this field are simple; to 
convey to a certain *number* of readers a 
certain number of words with a certain *degree* of legibility and convenience, at a 
certain cost. If publishing can be treated 
as a process in which these four variables 
appear, and to which any one of a number of 
technical devices may be applied, the results will be nothing less than revolutionary. 

How is a choice to be made among 
techniques? How is the most appropriate 
method of distributing a given text to be 
determined? When printing is assumed as 
the sole method of reproducing the material, 
the formula is very simple. There is given 
a certain number of words. The cost of {% include columnbreak.html canvas=353 col=2 %} printing that number of words is calculated 
easily. Then the actual or probable number 
of buyers must be calculated. If sales to 
these buyers at the price they are ready to 
pay will not liquidate the cost of printing 
and selling, a subsidy must be found. In
order to make the number of buyers as large 
as possible, certain standard promotion expenditures are made and financed into the 
production cost. The equation works out 
with great regularity in the conclusion 
that any number of words can be published 
provided 2000 buyers will purchase them in 
book form at normal prices ($1.20 per 100 
pages octavo). 

Ordinary commercial publishing will 
take care of the distribution on any material desired by 2000 paying customers. 
But a vast amount of material for scholarly use and a great many of the products of 
scholarship do not and should not receive 
such distribution. This is the penalty 
scholarship must pay for specialization. 
Therefore the problem of scholarly publishing and of the distribution of materials 
can be approached more realistically if another question is placed first on the list, 
another of the four variables first determined. Let us ask then, *how many copies of 
a given text ought to be distributed?* and 
analyze the various techniques from the 
standpoint of size of edition. 

## Size of Edition. The Efficiency Point

Every technique of reproduction 
that applies the principle of first cost 
and running cost has some edition size at 
which it reaches an efficiency that corresponds to some other edition size in the 
ease of another process. Of course, in all 
such techniques the point in edition size 
is ultimately reached when running costs 
are virtually the only costs that need to 
be considered. In the printing technique, 
for instance, editions of one or two million copies incur so large a running cost 
that the first cost appears only as a negligible item in the total. In microcopying {% include pagebreak.html canvas=354 %} short items to order, as in the Bibliofilm 
Service, where administrative costs are 
such that it is more economical to make a 
new negative for every order than to save 
negatives and make copies from them, the 
distinction between first cost and running 
cost disappears. The two costs are the 
same. Between these two extremes all the 
techniques of reproduction can be arranged 
in order in accordance with the size of 
edition at which they reach efficiency. 

The efficiency point is specific 
for each technique. The simplest point at 
which to. set it for each technique is at 
the size of edition at which running costs 
are just equal to first costs. In an edition that is smaller than the efficiency 
edition, a preponderant element in the cost 
of each unit is the first cost; in an edition that is larger than the efficiency 
edition, the preponderant cost element is 
the running cost. 

The efficiency point, thus defined, 
can be calculated for each process from the 
tables of costs in the foregoing chapters. 
The simplest common denominator for finding 
this point is the percentage relation of 
running cost of 100 copies to the first
cost of an edition. In photo-offset, for 
instance, the first cost of an 8 1/2" x 11" 
page is estimated at $2.00 for 100 copies, 
and running costs: at $.50 for each. additional 100 copies. It will cost $.30 to 
increase an edition from 100 to 200, and it 
will also cost $.30 to increase an edition 
from 2000 to 2100. The $.30 running cost 
is 15% of the $200 first cost. The corresponding percentages for all techniques 
are tabulated below in running costs per 
hundred copies. 

Each technique has a certain minimum edition which must be reckoned as a 
part of the first cost. In printing quotations, for instance, an edition of 50 costs 
as much as an edition of 100, and therefore the edition of 100 is a minimum. The
running costs really begin after the 100 
mark is passed. In photo-offset quotations the minimum is sometimes 50, sometimes 100; in mimeograph, it is 50; and in 
hectograph it is 10. In photostat and 
microphotography the minimum edition is one 
copy. Running costs for 100 copies, stated as percentages of the first cost in minimum edition, stand as follows: {% include columnbreak.html canvas=354 col=2 %}

TABLE XLIX 

RUNNING COSTS STATED AS PERCENTAGES OF FIRST COST 

|--------|--------:|
| Printing | 5% |
| Mimeoform | 8 |
| Photo-offset, with composition, in the format of this book | 10 |
| Photo-offset, without composition, as in all reprint work | 15 |
| Mimeograph, (normal 300-word format) including compositions | 25 |
| Hectograph, including composition | 130 |
| Microphotography, long runs with high first costs (as calculated for reproducing books printed before 1640) | | 
| High running costs | 730 |
| Low running costs | 1,500 |
| Microphotography, long runs with low first cost conditions (met 
in photographing NRA and AAA hearings) | 6,000 |
| Microcopying, short runs under cost conditions of Bibliofilm service, where cost of second copy is identical with cost of first copy, since negative film is not held for second copies | 10,000 |
| (This is the mathematical limit of the percentage relation) | |

From these percentage figures on 
running costs, the points of comparable efficiency in edition size can be calculated 
for each process. Cost of reproduction can be plotted as a curve rising as the 
size of the total edition rises. At a certain point the curve will rise to twice the 
height of the starting point. In printing,
this point will be reached at 2000 copies, 
in photo-offset (including composition) at 
1000, in mimeograph at 400, etc. The full 
table stands as shown on the following 
page. 

It would be possible to select some 
others point in edition size for purposes 
of comparing the various processes. For 
instance, we might ask, "At what size of 
edition will the unit costs be so compounded that only 10% of the cost of a copy is {% include pagebreak.html canvas=355 %}

TABLE L 

EFFICIENCY POINT IN EDITION FOR VARIOUS PROCESSES 

| Process | Size of edition at which running cost equals first cost, and hence total cost of edition is double the first cost |
|-----|-----:|
| Printing | 2,000 (plus 100 in first cost) |
| Mimeoform | 1,200 (plus 100 in first cost) |
| Photo-offset, including composition | 1,000 (plus 100 in first cost) |
| Photo-offset, without composition | 660 (plus 100 in first cost) |
| Mimeograph, (300-word format) with composition | 400 (plus 50 in first cost) |
| Hectograph, with composition | 77 (plus 10 in first cost) |
| Hectograph, without composition, as an alternative to typescript | 40 (plus 10 in first cost) |
| Microphotography, long run, high cost of filming and low cost of processing | 14 (plus 1 in first cost) |

| Microphotography, long run, low cost of filming (NRA and AAA) | 2 (plus 1 in first cost) |

incurred as a first cost in setting up the 
edition?" The edition sizes for the various processes would then stand as follows: {% include columnbreak.html canvas=355 col=2 %} On the chart (Table LII, on the 
following page), the curve of cost-per- 
copy has been computed for three processes, 

TABLE LI 

EDITION SIZE AT WHICH 90% OF THE UNIT COST IS RUNNING COST, AND 10% FIRST COST 

| Process | |
|-----|-----:|
| Printing | 20,000 |
| Mimeoform | 12,000 |
| Photo-offset, including composition | 10,000 |
| Photo-offset, without composition | 6,600 |
| Mimeograph | 4,000 |
| Hectograph (not technically possible) | |
| Microcopying, high first cost and low running cost | 140 |
| Microcopying, high first cost and high running cost | 70 |
| Microcopying, low first cost and low running cost | 20 |

These tables indicate edition sizes 
so far out of line with the demands of 
scholarship in all techniques, save those 
of microcopying, that the better point of 
comparison is certainly the size of edition 
at which running costs and first costs are 
equal. {% include columnbreak.html canvas=355 col=2 %} with data taken from the tables in foregoing chapters. The curves for printing, 
photo-offset and microcopying are set to 
different scales, but the behavior of the 
cost curve is the same for each. In each 
case most of the economies in cost-per-copy 
that are obtainable are secured before the {% include pagebreak.html canvas=356 %}

efficiency point is reached. When the edition is carried beyond the efficiency 
point, the cost-per-copy continues to fall, 
but it does not fall so rapidly. This fact
is of supreme importance in the strategy 
of publishing. It means that for any given number of copies there is some technique 
of reproduction that will function at or 
near its efficiency point. It means that
the most accurate comparison of processes 
can be made if each is considered as functioning at its efficiency point. If only 
ten copies of a given document are needed, 
printing and photo-offset are out of the 
question, for their costs-per-copy are 
above photostat. If 2000 copies are needed, most of the cost advantages of microcopying disappear. {% include columnbreak.html canvas=356 col=2 %}

## Comparative Costs per 100,000 Words at Efficiency Point 

If each technique is understood to 
be functioning at its efficiency point, 
there is a sound basis from which comparative costs can be computed in numbers of 
words. It is true that they photographic 
processes, when divorced from composition 
costs, apply to page or film areas, rather 
than to number of words, and that the number of words on a given area of paper or 
film is related to a factor of legibility 
and convenience. But this variable can be 
taken into account.in the statement of comparisons. (See Table LIII on the following. page.) 

The highest production cost at the 
efficiency point is that of the hectograph {% include pagebreak.html canvas=357 %}

TABLE LIII

COSTS PER THOUSAND WORDS AT EFFICIENCY POINT 

| Process | Efficiency Edition | Cost per Copy of 100,000 Words, Not Including Binding |
| Printing | 2,100 | | $.58 | (See table on economy format in Chapter III) |
| Mimeoform | 1,300 | .42 | |
| Photo-offset, without composition as reprint from economy format slightly reduced to fit photo-offset plate | 800 | .50 | (This is a 6¾" x 9½" page reduced to 6 x 9. The cost will vary with the degree of photographic reduction or enlargement) |
| Photo-offset, with typescript composition, in the format of this book | 1,100 | .77 | (This is an 8½" x 11" page. Note that the cost is a variable dependent on format and degree of reduction or enlargement from typescript) |
| Mimeograph, in 300-word format | 450 | .64 | |
| Hectograph, including composition | 87 | 1.58 | |
| Hectograph, without composition, when it is conceived as an alternative to the preparation of a fair-copy typescript, as in the doctoral dissertation published by Stanton L. Davis | 50 | 1.00 | |
| Microcopy, high first cost and low running cost | 14 | .33 | (Figures from Short Title Catalogue, at 400 words per page) |
| Microcopy, high first cost and high running cost | 8 | .62 | (Figures from Short Title Catalogue, at 400 words per page) |
| NRA and AAA type, with typescript pages figured at 300 words | 2 | .77 | (at 300 words per page) |

(including composition), roughly $1.50 for 
100,000 words in an edition just short of 
100. Another cost comparison of processes 
is that determining the edition size at 
which other techniques will multiply words 
at the same cost-per-copy ($1.50 for 
100,000 words). The figure is a reasonable 
one to accept as a standard, because it is 
a manufacturing cost that will permit the {% include columnbreak.html canvas=357 col=2 %} distribution of books at prices that would 
be regarded by the book-buying world as 
moderate. (See Table LIV on the following 
page.) 

The comparisons have been made with 
the costs of printings as a base line. But 
scholars often encounter another situation; 
they are familiar with another cost level. 
They will often wish to have a unique copy {% include pagebreak.html canvas=358 %}

TABLE LIV 

EDITION SIZE AT WHICH COST OF PRODUCTION IS APPROXIMATELY $1.50 PER 100,000 WORDS 

| Process | |
| Printing, (economy format) | 550 |
| Mimeoform | 200 |
| Photo-offset, without composition, (reprint of pages, 700 words, 6" x 9") | 150 |
| Photo-offset, with typescript composition, (format of this book) | 250 |
| Mimeograph | 115 |
| Hectograph | 90 |
| Microcopying, long run, high first cost, low running cost, at 400 words per page | 2 | 
| Microcopying, long run, low first cost low running cost (as with NRA hearings) | 1 (negative at 90¢, price does not rise to $1.50) |
| Microcopying, short run, Bibliofilm Service (Pages figured at 500 words to the page). The number of copies makes no difference, but the number of articles and their average length is crucial. 100,000 on 200 pages would be copied for $200, if all in ten-page lots; for $1.05, if all in one lot. The average length of item to be copied at $1.50 per 100,000 words would be twenty | 1 copy each of ten articles of twenty pages each |
| Microcopy, short run. The services at Yale, Library of Congress, New York Public Library, etc., at $3.00 per hundred double frames, or 200 pages. At this rate the 100,000 words would be available as unique copy for $3.00. | 1 copy, or 200 pages. 100,000 words as unique copy for $3.00 |

of a document made and will face the alternative of having it photostated or copied 
on a typewriter. 

The material which is normally thus 
photostated or copied in typescript is of 
two kinds: printed books, or stacks of 
loose typescript or manuscript pages. in 
order to compare the various techniques applicable to this demand situation, the same 
unit of 100,000 words can be used as an example. This would mean 250 pages of an ordinary book (400 words per page), or 144 
pages of a book with 700 words to the page, 
or 664 pages of typescript at 300 words to 
the page. 

Moreover, it is possible that a {% include columnbreak.html canvas=358 col=2 %} scholar might wish to make more than one 
copy by the devices that are primarily applied to the production of a single copy.
The zone of edition size above the unique 
copy and up to the edition of fifty is very 
little developed in ordinary practice, although there are a number of reasons for 
regarding it as a very important zone. An 
edition of fifty copies will make any document accessible in all of the greatest libraries of the country, and in every section of the country. Therefore scholars 
should have in hand information on costs of 
production in this low-edition zone. 

With these small-edition processes 
the reproduction of the book or typescript {% include pagebreak.html canvas=359 %} of 100,000 words begins always with one of 
the two basic procedures: a recopying on 
the typewriter, or a photographing, of the 
text as it stands. The first, being a composition cost, is the same for any unit of 
100,000 words, whether it stands originally as a printed book or as a stack of typewritten pages. The second, being an area 
cost, is dependent upon the total area of 
page (the size of the page multiplied by 
the number of pages), and upon the degree 
of enlargement or reduction given to the 
material in photographing it. 

The two techniques---copying on typewriter and photographing the existing pages---furnish alternative starting points. But 
there are a number of combinations in which 
the typescript copying is followed by some 
use of a photographic technique. The photographic techniques, since they permit reductions in size, lead to problems of legibility, and at a certain point begin to demand auxiliary reading devices, such as 
reading glasses, binocular microscopes, or 
projection reading machines. 

The simplest classification of 
these processes is one that divides them 
into two main groups: first, those beginning with the making of a typescript copy 
of the text; and second, those beginning 
with the making of a photographic copy of 
the text. The second, or photographic, 
techniques will exhibit different costs, 
following the number of words per page and 
page area. A minimum for an octavo book is 
perhaps 400 words, a maximum 900 words. The 
table on the following page is calculated 
on the basis of a 400-word page, 6" x 9", 
and hence 250 pages of print as against 334 
pages of typescript. The larger the number 
of words per page in the book, the greater 
will be the advantage of the photographic 
processes over those that begin with a retyping. The processes will yield two classes of result: those legible without optical aid, and those requiring the aid of a 
lens or projector reader. 

## The Allocation of Costs of Reproducing Materials 

From the welter of figures and estimates set forth in the preceding 
chapters, and epitomized in the tables above, 
the conclusion follows inescapably that 
printing is no longer to be regarded as the 
sole technique by which the materials and {% include columnbreak.html canvas=359 col=2 %} products of research are to be reproduced. 

It follows also that the financing 
of the reproduction and distribution of research materials may now be accomplished in 
ways that depart from the standards and 
practices of normal commercial publishing. 
The essential elements of commercial publishing finance are derived from printing 
technique. There has always been a high 
first cost, a low running cost, and consequently a profit in the large edition. 
There must, therefore, be promotional expenses to extend the market and draw in the 
largest possible number of purchasers. Commercial publishing will be most profitable 
if it can distribute the largest number of 
copies of the smallest number of titles. 
The needs of research pull in the opposite 
direction, toward the distribution of the 
largest number of titles in the smallest 
editions. 

Microcopying techniques bring into 
the picture an entirely new pattern of financing. They impose upon the consumer the 
kind of "first cost" that printing imposes 
on the producer. Since the consumer, 
whether a library or an individual, must 
have a reading machine, he must make a substantial investment before he can read any 
microcopies. But after his investment is 
made, he pays only a small price for his 
reading matter. The more reading matter he 
procures, the more completely his first 
cost is absorbed. 

Moreover, the microcopying techniques reach their efficiency point in so 
small a number of copies that promotional 
expenses are cut to a low minimum. It takes 
very little promotion to reach the necessary number of purchasers. And after the efficiency point is reached, later purchasers 
can be cared for by running off for each 
one the copy that he requires, without incurring the costs of a new edition. The 
problems known to commercial publishing as 
promotion, overprint, and risk are substantially modified or absent when the microcopying technique is used. 

The use of the techniques that are 
operative in the range below a hundred copies permits a similar change in the financial perspective. Here also the high promotion charge can be avoided, because the 
effective market is pretty well known in advance. Moreover, some of these techniques, 
notably the hectograph, operate at so low a {% include pagebreak.html canvas=360 %}

{% include pagebreak.html canvas=361 %} cost level that the author himself can absorb the cost of production and the risk of 
loss. A substantial amount of scholarly 
publishing is carried on at present by 
means of subsidies from the author or from 
some institution representing an author interest. By shifting the technique of reproduction to one of the cheap, small-edition processes, the subsidy requirement can 
be diminished far below that which would be 
needed for publication in print. 

Of course if an author expects to 
receive revenue from his research writing, 
he can not get it unless his writing is of 
the type that is appropriate for commercial publishing. The technical problem in 
the reproduction of his writing appears at 
another level, where the author is interested in the intangible rewards that are 
offered by the world of scholarship. In 
these cases the author sometimes makes a 
substantial investment in the reproduction 
of his work, either in the form of a subsidy to the press, or in the purchase of 
copies which he distributes to his colleagues. Author-financed reproduction of 
materials is far less burdensome with small 
edition techniques than with commercial 
publishing techniques. 

The possibility of choosing a technique to respond to the demand for a product encourages the development of another 
financing device, which would pro-rate the 
costs of production and distribution among 
purchasers. This device was examined in 
1933 by the Joint Committee, and an experiment in its use is under way in 1936. 

The essential element of the plan 
is the pro-*rating* of the cost of production 
among the purchasers, who are brought together before the production is launched 
and the sales price per copy fixed. This 
involves as a corollary the *appraisal* of 
the value of the work prior to its publication. 

## Publication Service of Microcopying 

Another plan, utilizing the microcopying technique, is being launched in 
1936 under the auspices of Science Service, 
with the collaboration of the Bibliofilm 
Service. The announcement of this plan, 
which is essentially one of deposit for 
microcopying in lieu of publication, is 
given out by Dr. Watson Davis in the following circular to the editors of scientific publications. {% include columnbreak.html canvas=361 col=2 %}

> The development of photographic techniques makes it possible for 
    Science Service to extend to you an 
    invitation to participate in an auxiliary plan of publication which, we believe, will be of aid to you in editing your journal, proceedings, or 
    other media of publication, and to 
    scientific publication in general. 
  
> You, in common with other 
    scientific editors, are probably under pressure from authors to publish 
    papers of too great length or of too 
    specialized content. Or there are 
    papers that you would like to print 
    in extenso if finances permitted. To 
    a small specialized audience, these 
    papers in complete detail should be 
    made available. 

> The following suggested procedure will secure effective publication and conserve your finances. It 
    is hoped that you will join with us 
    in putting it into effect:
  
> Publish as much or as little 
    of a paper as you wish in your journal. In the case of a very technical 
    paper, this may be merely an abstract 
    or summary. State at the end of the 
    published item: "For detailed paper 
    order Document \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ from Science 
    Service, 2101 Constitution Ave., 
    Washington, D.C., remitting \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 
    cents for microfilm form and \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 
    cents for photocopies readable without optical aid." The author will 
    have his paper typed in an acceptable 
    standard form (black fresh ribbon on 
    8 1/2" x 11" bond paper, single 
    spaced, preferably pica type) and he 
    will have photographs mounted separately on same sized sheets. This material will be deposited by you with 
    Science Service as a document. Science 
    Service will assign a serial document 
    number and set a price per copy of the 
    document in microfilm or photocopy 
    form. Those who wish to have the document will be able to obtain it by 
    ordering it directly from Science 
    Service in response to the notice published in your journal. 

> The operation of this plan of 
    auxiliary publication will be simple 
    and uncomplicated. Science Service 
    desires that you and other editors use 
    it when, how, and if it is helpful. We {% include pagebreak.html canvas=362 %} ask no financial participation or 
    guarantees on your part or the part 
    of the author. We only ask that you 
    signify your intention of using this 
    publication method if and when it 
    fits into your editorial plans, and 
    that you give the paper to be deposited such editorial supervision 
    as you deem necessary. 
  
The agreement to be entered into by 
the editors of scientific publications 
using the service is drafted as follows: 

> COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT FOR UTILIZATION 
    OF THE PUBLICATION SERVICE OF THE DOCUMENTATION DIVISION OF SCIENCE SERVICE

## Publication Service by a Deferred Payment Plan 

Edwards Brothers of Ann Arbor have 
a standing offer intended to facilitate 
small-edition publishing by a simplifying 
of the distribution of risk between publisher and author or subsidizer. The terms 
of this proposal are the following: 

1. They assume 50% of the initial cost. 

2. The author, institution, or foundation 
assumes the other half, either in cash 
or in the form of advance orders on 
the book. 

3. The advance is made for six months from 
date of publication, with a carrying 
charge of 10% based on the cost of the 
edition. 

4. Repayment of the advance is made through 
first sales. Their experience has been 
that the author is seldom called upon 
to repay in cash---sales usually taking 
care of his indebtedness to them. 

5. At the end of six months, any unpaid 
balance is to be paid; if this is not 
feasible, arrangements can be made for 
an extension. 

6. If the book sells better than estimated, 
the author within three months can assume the entire cost, in which case 
their 10% carrying charge is eliminated. 

7. All net sales, after the advance is repaid, are credited to the author 
towards royalty, payable April and 
September 15 each year. 

8. They store, ship, and bill all books 
published under this arrangement, thus 
sparing the author or institution all 
mechanical sales routine. {% include columnbreak.html canvas=363 col=2 %}

In addition to these services, 
Edwards Brothers offers a publishing service described as follows: 

1. They prepare and mail to a list of logical readers a circular describing the 
book and reproducing specimen pages from 
it so that the prospective purchaser may 
see the format. 

2. This list may be furnished by the author 
or made up from the proper directories, 
membership lists, faculties, etc. 

3. They list all books, according to title,
author, format, date of publication, 
price, and publisher, in the appropriate 
indexes and in Publishers' Weekly, the 
book-trade journal. 

4. They send out review copies of books to 
the important periodicals in the field 
concerned. Their list of 1400 periodicals classified by subject enables them 
to select for publicity purposes those 
magazines and journals which concern 
themselves particularly with the material treated. 

5. For this service their charge is $25 for 
250 names circularized, and $20 for each 
additional 250. There is no charge for 
publicity beyond this. 

The production technique used in 
this case is photo-offset from typescript. 
The offer is really a breakdown of publishing service into separate elements of 
which the author can purchase as many or as 
few as he chooses, and a credit scheme that 
will give the author a chance to get 50% of 
the production price from book purchasers. 

According to a letter just recently received, Edwards Brothers report that 
their plan is working quite successfully. 
They have had a number of books, ranging 
in an edition of from 300 to 400, which are 
selling and which are paying their own way. 
Their experience has been that they can, 
with an edition of 300 or 400 copies, produce a book which will sell at approximately current book prices of comparable material. In addition, they are finding that 
there is little if any objection to the format in which these books are prepared. Reviewers no longer comment on the format, 
and if they do, their comments are almost 
always favorable. An indication that there 
is no objection is the fact that the number 
of orders which they receive each day is {% include pagebreak.html canvas=364 %} constantly increasing. At the present time 
it averages from thirty to fifty orders per 
day. 

This up-to-date information coming 
directly from the publishers using the plan 
is very encouraging, in that it indicates 
the favorable reception accorded the plan, 
and also the fact that these smaller editions will sell and pay for themselves. 

## The Services of the H. W. Wilson Company 

The H. W. Wilson Company has had 
extensive experience in a special method of 
pro-rating costs of production among purchasers. The series of guides to periodical literature published by this company 
are priced on the basis of the number of 
analyzed periodicals to which the purchaser 
subscribes. 

Another service of the Wilson Company is its vertical file service, which 
circulates among libraries a classified 
subject list of pamphlets and similar material that may be available either gratis 
or at cost of supply. It will be easy to 
arrange with the Wilson Company to receive 
titles of near-print memoranda issued by 
scholars on scholarly subjects, to circulate the notices of the material in the 
classified list, and to arrange for distribution to the libraries upon demand. 

## Plans for the Photo-Offset Reproduction of Rare Items 

The proficiency with which the 
photo-offset technique will bring rare books 
into print has led to a number of systematic experiments in organizing reproduction 
of them. 

The Facsimile Text Society was organized with a list of subscribing members 
and an editorial board to choose titles for 
reproduction. It could not escape the need 
for a large-edition sale, nor could it pro-rate actual costs among actual subscribers 
to a given title. In short, while it did
not use printing techniques, and tried in 
its promotion to find a plan halfway between that of a journal with a subscriber 
list and that of a book publisher, it did 
not escape the accountancy and risks of 
book publishing. 

Mr. John A. Neu of the Library of 
Congress has been a promotor of a large-scale plan for rearranging and rationalizing book holdings of American libraries. {% include columnbreak.html canvas=364 col=2 %} One part of his plan called for the multiplying of rare books. The idea that the 
production of the reprints should be 
planned to fit into a comprehensive arrangement of book resources in the country was 
new. The scheme did not get beyond the 
memorandum stage. 

The H. W. Wilson Company has developed an effective book exchange service 
that should prove very sensitive in registering reprint demand. The company published a catalogue of essays and general 
literature as a kind of checklist for libraries. Since many of the items on this 
list were out of print, it issued a special 
list of the out-of-print books, and invited 
libraries and secondhand dealers to report 
copies for sale. Six titles were so much 
in demand, and so little in supply, that 
the Wilson Company made reprint editions---in this case from plates rather than by 
photo-offset---but the results were not a 
striking success. It may be that the immediately effective demand for the reprint 
of a particular rare and out-of-print book 
does not often pass the efficiency point of 
the reprint process, whether by photo-offset or from the plates. The problem, again, 
is one of financing the smallest possible 
edition. 

## Concentration of Scholarly Book Production 

In the past few years there have 
been a number of proposals that look to the 
achievement of economies of consolidation 
in scholarly book publishing. It will be 
proposed, for instance, that university 
presses should merge to avoid wasteful duplication, or that a gigantic) union publishing institution should be set up to 
compete with existing prices for profitable 
manuscripts, and expend its profits in the 
production of small-edition, loss-sustaining research books. The evidence accumulated in the preceding pages amply warrants 
the conclusion that the mere increasing of 
the size of present publishing operations 
will not meet present needs. What is necessary is a new design, and the use of new 
techniques, to the end that editions will 
finance themselves regardless of the number 
of buyers---whether it be ten or ten thousand. {% include pagebreak.html canvas=365 %}

## Concentration of Processing Services for Microcopying 

The development of microcopying on 
paper and film promises to yield low prices 
that will result in widespread use, and the 
widespread use will then reflect back in 
low prices. The critical problem of the 
moment is the maintenance of a low price 
level during the period of development that 
is bringing about the widespread use. 

The institution which is probably 
most necessary for the achievement of this 
objective is a photographic processing center which can offer the following services: 

1. Accept microcopy negatives, either 16 mm, 
or 35 mm., both in short and long runs, 
and service them to buyers by making on 
order positive prints in the same size, 
or in enlargement or reduction, and possibly on paper. 

2. Pro-rate the costs of making a negative 
among purchasers of the positive on a 
non-profit basis. 

3. Guarantee the highest technical standards in the care of the negative and the 
processing of the positive. 

While it is highly desirable to encourage the development of a number of alternative photographing and reading machines, there is no advantage in splitting 
up the work of processing among a number of 
agencies. Efficient machinery is very expensive and calls for large footages. The 
scholar who returns from Europe with a few 
thousand feet of microcopies of unpublished 
material, the library that has made a negative of its newspaper file, the group of 
libraries which may be organizing an undertaking such as the copying of English books 
published before 1640, could all make use 
of a processing center. The accountancy 
standards remain to be worked out; they 
will show marked differences from the accountancy of publishing. They should be 
established on the assumption of large footages. 

Five years ago, when the first edition of this report was issued, it seemed 
that the most important need in the field 
of microcopying was mechanical---the efficient camera and reading machine. At this 
date of writing, the mechanical problems 
are so well on the road to solution that 
they need not cause concern. The next prob{% include columnbreak.html canvas=365 col=2 %}lem is one of institutional development and 
of the standardizing of a low price level. 

## Allocation of Costs, and the Problem of Appraisal and Listing 

The problem of allocation of cost 
is intimately related to the problem of appraising the research value of material 
that is to be multiplied by any technique 
for any number of users. 

The cost may be assessed against 
the author (or some institution interested, 
like the author, in promoting distribution), 
or against the library and the individual 
consumer, or it may be distributed among 
them. It may be met by any one of the 
three interests identified in the first 
chapter of this book as the producer, consumer, and custodian interest, or by all of 
them in different proportions. But the allocation of cost cannot be made except in 
the presence of some kind of appraisal. 

If the author bears the whole cost 
of multiplying the book and distributes it 
free of charge to libraries, no act of appraisal of the book is necessary except 
that which the receivers of the book will 
perform in deciding whether to shelve the 
gift or put it in the wastebasket. 

If the people who are to acquire 
the book are to be asked to contribute 
toward the cost of multiplying it, the 
work of appraising must precede their decision to assume part of the cost of multiplying. 

At present this appraising is done 
in two ways. The most common is that used 
in the publishing trade. An editor appraises a manuscript and makes a decision 
to publish; then reviewers step in, and on 
the basis of their reviews purchasers make 
their decisions. 

Sometimes the editors assume so 
much responsibility, as in bringing out a 
series, that the purchasers do not await 
the second appraisal made by reviewers. 
This is the second of the two systems now 
in use.

These methods do not place a large 
proportion of the cost on the purchasers of 
books; the author of a Ph.D. dissertation 
bears) most of the cost. 

Both of these methods of appraising 
books and distributing their cost between 
authors and buyers leave a large margin of 
risk. While they have been developed in {% include pagebreak.html canvas=366 %} connection with the technique of printing, 
they are not necessarily tied to that technique. 

A third arrangement would be possible. The appraising of the book could be 
made, not only prior to the multiplying of 
it, but prior even to the distribution of 
its cost between author and purchasers. 
This is the system proposed in a memorandum of the Joint Committee on a publishing 
service. 

There are two functions in connection with the distribution of the results 
of research which are more intellectual 
than mechanical. The first is the entering of information regarding the research 
product in bibliographical guides; the second is the appraising of the merit of the 
research product. This work is done by 
professional scholars, who may or may not 
be remunerated for it. 

The two functions are related. A 
bibliographical entry implies a degree of 
appraisal; at least the research product 
must be assumed to relate to the topic under which it is entered. This amount of 
appraising can be left to the author or, 
in the case of Ph.D. theses, to those under 
whom the work was done. 

The more complete appraising that 
is necessary before asking purchasers to 
contribute toward the cost of multiplying 
a book is not so properly left to the 
author or his advisor. 

No matter what techniques of reproduction are used in multiplying a text, 
these problems of appraisal and assessment 
of cost arise. 

The rational use of these available techniques requires, however, that the 
intellectual elements of the distributing 
process, namely, bibliographical entry and 
appraisal, should be made available regardless of the technique of multiplying. 

## Intellectual Implications of Technological Change
 
A change in the procedure of appraisal of material and a development of 
bibliographical services to include material not commercially published open the way 
to far-reaching changes in the intellectual standards of scholarship. At the same 
time the prospect that a scholar may be 
able to have material that was otherwise 
inaccessible brought to him, and that he {% include columnbreak.html canvas=366 col=2 %} may be able to communicate to his colleagues 
writings that he has hitherto been unable 
to communicate to them, open the way to new 
intellectual opportunities. An analysis of 
these new standards and opportunities points 
toward a large-scale redivision of scholarly labor, which may take a course parallel 
to that which industrial technology introduced when it opened to the semi-skilled a 
great field previously occupied by the 
highly skilled. 

The semi-skilled in scholarship 
have played a very small role in intellectual life for the past few generations; the 
amateur has given way to the professional 
in research, and the vast corps of teachers 
in the secondary schools have not been mustered into the army of productive scholarship. The concentration of scholarly work 
has taken place not only in respect of personnel, but also in respect of location. 
Large library resources have become so necessary that most of the work has been drawn 
to great cities and university centers. We 
look out now upon a prospect of change, 
which can be examined in several aspects. 
First among these aspects is the prospective disintegration of the distinction between collecting and publishing. 

Microcopying and the reproduction 
techniques that are operative in the zone 
of ten copies tend to obliterate this distinction, because they mean that any collection of material---whether in manuscript, 
typescript, or book or pamphlet form---can 
be duplicated or multiplied in whole or in 
part upon demand. If a library has collected the theatre programs, political 
broadsides, or other documents originating 
in its community, this material has not 
only been preserved from destruction, but 
also prepared for distribution. Moreover, 
a collection of material can be made logically complete, regardless of the accident 
of the market, and become in that way an 
organized unit, as if it were a vast and 
well-designed book. Collections of documents in the hands of any librarians or individuals who are willing to permit their 
copying become part of a great reservoir of 
documentation, open to all comers, irrespective of whether or not any item is a "book 
in print."

This conception---that collecting 
and publishing are functionally merged---should operate to expand and dignify the {% include pagebreak.html canvas=367 %} role of the collector, and at the same time 
to clarify the position of the research 
worker. It should become increasingly difficult for scholars to publish undigested 
material in the expectation that their work 
will be credited as if it were a true product of research, provided only that the 
texts as published had not previously appeared in print. Already the effect of the 
new techniques can be felt. A number of 
scholars have gone into European archives 
and brought home collections of documents 
numbering into the thousands in microcopy 
form. If they had gone with pen and ink 
or with typewriter, and laboriously copied 
out a few hundred documents they might have 
been tempted to confuse the result of their 
physical labor with an intellectual product. Since it is now evident that the camera can not only copy documents by the thousands, but also permit their duplication to 
order and upon demand, the difference between the mere collection of documents and 
their research use stands out with a clarity it could not previously have possessed. 

This observation does not decry the 
value to culture of that work which tends 
to improve and expand records, to make them 
more accessible, and to notify those who 
should be interested in them of their existence. This is an essential service which 
must be rendered. But there should arise a 
new conception of division of labor in 
scholarship, combined with a willingness to 
apportion tasks to the abilities and opportunities of those who are available to do 
the work. 

The labor of research is doubly divisible. It can be divided vertically into 
ever narrower fields, and it can be divided horizontally into different stages in 
the preparation of material. At the first 
level stands the collection of records---the 
function generally left with librarians and 
archivists. Between the collection of texts 
and the distribution of conclusions drawn 
from their study, there stands a long intermediate series of operations, to each of 
which there corresponds some appropriate 
intellectual technique in the treatment of 
the material, and some appropriate mechanical technique for its reproduction. 

Many of the obstacles to be overcome in the development of the full material resources of intellectual life are found 
in the attitudes of the scholars themselves. {% include columnbreak.html canvas=367 col=2 %} Too often there is a veneration of book 
print at the expense of typescript, and 
too frequently a disposition to take for 
granted the finality of the existing distribution of labor. But an examination of 
the whole problem of materials for research 
discloses the fact that the problem can not 
be solved in terms of book publishing on 
the one hand, and the labor of professional 
scholars alone on the other. 

The nature of the whole problem of 
materials for research will be clarified 
if it is examined as a series of operations 
that begins with the collecting of original 
material and ends with the dissemination of 
the results of research. 

## The First Stage: Collecting and Preserving Material 

We are called upon to manipulate a 
civilization based primarily upon the use 
of two substances---metal and paper. Just 
as our economic life has come to be based 
upon the use of metals, so our intellectual 
life has its material foundations in the 
use of paper. 

The world of paper is a world of 
vast dimensions. Primarily, it is not a 
world of books. A single copy of the New 
York *Times* contains more words than a full-length novel. Books constitute only a 
small part of the printed reading matter 
that is laid before our eyes. Most of the 
printed material that is distributed is distributed in newspaper form. But the newspapers absorb only a fraction of the actual 
writing that is done. In every business 
office there are typewriters that clatter 
all day putting words and numbers on paper. 
That which is printed is only a fraction of 
that which is written and communicated. For 
every ton of paper that is converted into 
records, there are, perhaps, only a few 
pounds that will ever be added to the permanent heritage of records to be utilized in 
the study of our civilization, and preserved 
for the future. 

How is the selection to be made of 
records that are to be preserved? How are 
they to be segregated from the records 
destined for destruction? And how is the 
scholar to be guided among those that are 
preserved, to the end that their preservation will prove to be worth while? Our 
libraries operate efficiently in respect of 
certain classes of books and periodicals, {% include pagebreak.html canvas=368 %} and even of newspapers and some kinds of 
old manuscripts. But there are vast domains of records which our libraries cannot be expected to govern. The records of 
business and of government and the private 
papers of families must, in the long run, 
be cared for by business and government and 
the family. Only by inculcating in people 
who are not professional scholars a sense 
of the value of records, and by teaching a 
technique applicable to their selective 
destruction and preservation, can this 
great bulk of record material be given a 
rational treatment. A program that would 
attempt to solve the problems of preserving and improving materials for research, 
without any resources but those of professional scholars and research libraries, 
will leave the great decisions to the play 
of accident. 

Even the ample and intelligent selection and preservation of records that 
are made in the course of practical life 
would still leave a great gap in the documentation. Are there not many kinds of information that are of intrinsic interest 
and value to research scholarship, even 
though they do not take the form of records 
unless a deliberate effort is made to record them? This is true not only in the 
field of linguistics, but also in political
and business history, and in family history 
as well. The development of radio, which, 
does not automatically make a paper record, 
imposes a special duty of recording for 
permanence, if the archive of culture is to 
be complete. 

The field of original record is so 
vast that the conclusion must be self-evident; only the recruiting of forces supplementary to those of professional scholars 
and research libraries will bring ample and 
intelligent action in the preserving of old 
records, in the selection of contemporary 
records for preservation, and in the making 
of new records. 

The human interests that may be 
turned to account to improve our resources 
of record are many. Chief among them are 
the genealogical interest, the interest of 
people engaged in business in the background and prospects of their business, the 
collector's interest in a good collection 
of anything from postage stamps to incunabula, and perhaps a feeling for the prestige-value of contributions made to the intellectual world. 

{% include columnbreak.html canvas=368 col=2 %} We are not yet intellectually prepared to develop these human resources. We 
do not yet know exactly how to instruct the 
college student of today, the business man 
of tomorrow, in the techniques and values 
that he ought to know if he is to participate in a great common enterprise in the development of record resources. We have not 
yet worked out fully the institutional arrangements by which collections of records, 
preserved from the past or made in the present, can be appraised, reported, and brought 
to the attention of those who can use them. 
We have not yet analyzed thoroughly the 
categories into which research materials 
fall, nor devised for each category appropriate principles to govern their preservation, selection, creation, or listing for 
use. This intellectual problem would exist 
for us, even if we were still dependent 
upon book publishing for all multiplying of 
research materials. But the new techniques, 
since they render collecting almost equivalent to publishing, make the problem far 
more pressing, and the opportunity far 
greater, than it has been in the past. 

## The Second Stage: the Improvement of Different Types of Material 

The creation, preservation, and 
collection of research material in vast 
quantities will embarrass rather than aid 
scholarship, unless appropriate measures 
are taken to improve it by arranging it 
properly, and controlling it by means of 
lists, inventories, calendars, and other 
ways. 

The classes of record that account 
for the greatest bulk of paper tonnage are 
the following: 

### (a) Books, Periodicals, and Printed Public Documents 

Present library techniques are adequate to care for this material, although 
library resources are in some cases insufficient. The public documents of the American states and of foreign governments are 
very inadequately represented in American 
libraries. But the method of meeting this 
deficiency will probably be found to involve no other changes than an increase in 
library resources or a distribution of library responsibilities, to the end that the 
holdings and acquisitions of one library 
may dovetail with those of another, and the 
technique of microcopying provides {% include pagebreak.html canvas=369 %} inter-library service. The union catalogue 
of libraries and the union lists of news- 
papers and public documents are the tools 
required for the improvement of this situation. The Wilson Company has made a 
union list of periodicals and of public documents, and a number of union catalogue 
projects are under way, notably the great 
Project B of the Library of Congress, and 
the union list of the holdings of libraries 
in Philadelphia. 

### (b) Newspapers 

The newspaper resources of the country, taken as a whole, reveal just such 
gaps as are shown in periodical and foreign 
public document holdings. A newspaper 
union list is in the making, but newspapers 
present two additional tasks. The paper 
upon which newspapers have been printed 
since the last quarter of the nineteenth 
century is so highly perishable that the 
whole newspaper record will be lost unless 
large-scale copying or preserving is done. 
Probably the best plan will be to microcopy the files, but, despite the low costs 
of the process, this will be a long and expensive process. 

The bulk of newspaper files is so 
great and the miscellaneous character of 
their contents so general, that a distinct 
step forward in the improvement of this 
type of record can be made by indexing, 
calendaring, or digesting the files. The 
Joint Committee has experimented with the 
technique of making a newspaper digest in 
Cleveland, adapting the procedure to the 
training and abilities of a high-school 
graduate relief worker, and planning to 
multiply the resulting digest by means of 
the multigraph process. Though the hectographed digest will not be permanent, it 
will last long enough to provide many years 
of study, and a microcopy of the digest will 
be made to give absolute permanence to the 
work. 

The labor cost of indexing or digesting newspaper materials is so great 
that the work can hardly be accomplished except under one of two conditions--either it 
can be developed by paid labor as a part of 
a relief program, or it can be done in 
small increments by people interested in 
the variety of information that the old 
newspapers reveal, and willing to work to 
put the material into near-print form for {% include columnbreak.html canvas=369 col=2 %} the sake of the intangible reward of scholarly recognition. The newspaper digest is 
a halfway product, intermediate between the 
raw newspaper material and the finished result of research. 

There is one great news source that 
is not at present preserved in any form. 
This is the typescript material that passes over the wires of the great news services. It is the raw material of news, nearer to source than the newspaper itself, and 
more independent of the whim of the city 
editor. Dr. T. R. Schellenberg has taken 
the lead in promoting the preservation of 
this type of material by the microcopy 
technique. 

### (c) Public Archives 

The erection of a National Archives 
building and the creation of a National 
Archives administration mark a new day in 
the treatment of public records in the 
United States. This country has hitherto 
been backward---almost barbarous---in the 
care of its public records. The conjunction of the establishment of the National 
Archives and the promotion of white-collar 
relief projects under the Works Progress 
Administration is changing this picture. 
Two large-scale and systematic inventories 
have been organized throughout the country 
under the Works Progress Administration, 
the one to make an identification inventory 
of the records of local public bodies, the 
other to make an inventory of federal records outside of Washington. The Historical 
Records Survey, under the direction of 
Dr. Luther Evans, is also covering some of 
the manuscript records, especially those in 
historical societies, and consolidating information regarding then, 

There are three questions relating 
to public archives which deeply concern research scholars. First is the question of 
record destruction. No archive administration can or should preserve everything, 
and yet the selection of material for preservation, and the decision on what to destroy, are not easily made. Second is the 
question of inventory. Even if records are 
preserved, they are of little use to scholars until they have been inventoried and 
arranged. And third is the question of access and administration. As local archives 
come to be better known and their research 
uses better understood, it will follow that {% include pagebreak.html canvas=370 %} people who are not close to large libraries 
will have an increasing array of opportunities for research. It may be that techniques comparable to that which is being 
developed in the making of a newspaper digest can be worked out, to result in an 
equivalent increase in the accessibility 
and utility of local archival material. 

Though sociologists have utilized 
local data very effectively, the historians, economists, and political scientists 
have devoted far more attention to the national scene. A leading political scientist, who is undertaking a study of the 
rise of machine politics in American cities, found that the basic preparatory work 
has not been done. The practical need for 
the study of regional economic opportunities finds economics far better equipped 
with statistics on national trends than 
with scientific analyses of local situations. Newspapers and the local archives 
are a vein of raw ore inviting the labor of 
a host of workers to dig out material and 
refine the product. 

### (d) Business Records 

The archives of business are no 
less important than the archives of government, but they are not ordinarily administered with a view to their research value 
in the future. When an office manager is 
employed to increase the working efficiency of a business office, one of his first
points of attack is the storage of old records. He tries to get them destroyed to 
save storage space. No business can afford to retain all records in their original and bulky form, The Recordak Corporation offers to business firms an opportunity to reduce greatly the space required 
for the preservation of old files. Nevertheless, the introduction of sound scholarly archival principles into the care of 
business records is a program for the future, rather than a fact of the present. 

The Joint Committee made an experiment in inducing a firm to apply the principle of sampling to the preservation of 
records. Halle Brothers, a Cleveland department store, withdrew from the normal 
course of destruction sample runs of all 
its types of records to cover a period 
prior to the introduction of NRA and a period subsequent thereto. Most American business firms have already destroyed the orig{% include columnbreak.html canvas=370 col=2 %}inal pay rolls, materials cards, work cards, 
etc., that would document the story of this 
experiment in large-scale change of working 
standards. At the suggestion of Professor 
N. S. B. Gras, of Harvard University Graduate School of Business Administration, 
Mr. Ralph M. Hower was employed to draw up 
a report on the records and methods of record preservation used by ten different companies of considerable age and importance. 
The Business Historical Society is interested in developing a technique for the 
preservation of the important segments of 
business records. But the road forward is 
not so clear in the case of business records as it is with public archives, newspapers, and the books and periodicals 
handled by libraries through the book trade. 

### (e) Ephemeral Materials and Non-Trade Documentation 

Though the library technique for 
dealing with books, periodicals, and newspapers is well established, the same can 
hardly be said of ephemeral items such as 
political posters and broadsides, pamphlets, 
advertising matter, theatre programs, and 
a great variety of near-print matter. 

Dr. Kuhlman of the University of Chicago 
Library is preparing a manual for librarians on the collection and arrangement of 
this type of material. But here also there 
is a great field for the individual collector. During the World War a large number 
of individuals in Germany and many in 
France began their "war collections." There 
were several journals published to serve 
the collectors. With the close of the war 
this interest diminished. But there are 
an almost infinite number of subjects upon 
which the serious and comprehensive activity of an individual collector can bring 
valuable results. Every labor dispute in 
a modern city gives rise to its little 
budget of leaflets and announcements from 
the different labor groups and the management. Every demonstration of relief 
clients is accompanied by its paper shower. 
These documents are a part of the record of 
civilization that will not come to be preserved and organized, except as individuals 
or local libraries take a special interest 
and apply a sound technique. 

### (f) Family Papers 

The restricted space in which the {% include pagebreak.html canvas=371 %} modern family lives, and the frequent moving from apartment to apartment that becomes normal in urban civilization, make 
the hoarding of family papers, whether 
ancient or current, a burdensome load. Surveys of historical documentation in New 
York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and other 
places have disclosed a wealth of valuable 
records in the form of old letters. The 
complete rationalization of the care of 
family papers would call for at least three 
things: first, the reporting of holdings 
of old papers; second, the proper selection, preservation, and care of current papers; and third, a responsibility in each 
family to record the history of itself, or 
the biography of its members. 

The interest that many individuals 
develop in genealogy can perhaps be channeled in such a way that it will yield results valuable to the world of scholarship. 
Dr. Jean Stephenson, Chairman of the Genealogical Records Committee of the Daughters 
of the American Revolution, is sounding out 
this possibility and is prepared to develop it in a forthcoming manual on genealogical research. 

Thus the collection, selection, 
listing and care of records, whether public 
archives, business documents, or family papers, is a vast task in which a large element of the population can be trained to 
share. The value of everything they do will 
be increased by the greater mobility that 
all records possess by virtue of the new 
techniques of reproduction. 

## Simplified Research Techniques 

Above the level of the simple collecting and organizing of material, there 
lies a zone of possible activity intermediate between the higher research, to which 
the highly trained professional scholars 
may be expected to devote their time, and 
the more humble task of accumulating and 
arranging. The proposal has been presented to the American Council of Learned Societies and the Social Science Research 
Council that steps should be taken to devise simplified research techniques, by 
which the semi-skilled in scholarship could 
make their contributions, and those who 
have only a limited amount of time or limited documentary equipment for research, 
may be brought to contribute their share. 
The development of simplified re{% include columnbreak.html canvas=371 col=2 %}search techniques in the social studies and 
some of the humanities would result in an 
increase in the actual working personnel of 
American scholarship, especially by drawing 
in the following types of workers: 

a) University, college, and high-school 
teachers who, because of limitations of 
time, materials or training, are not 
able to keep the pace set by the most 
advanced research workers. 

b) College graduates, not engaged in academic work, but having at their disposal 
time and interests---in some cases money 
---that can be devoted to scholarly purposes. 

c) Business men whose interest in their own 
business or the economic setting of 
their own community is guided toward accurate and sound methods of investigation. 

The broadening of the base of the 
pyramid of scholarly activity would contribute to the whole field of education. 
The schism in the intellectual world that 
resulted from the preoccupation of those 
interested in pedagogy with methods of instruction, at the expense of content of 
learning, and of research workers in content, at the expense of methods of instruction, has not strengthened, but rather has 
weakened intellectual life. It has resulted in a situation in which the teaching 
career, especially in the secondary school, 
is made less attractive in terms of intellectual dignity than it would need to 
be. A good teacher can always teach more 
effectively if she is able to illustrate 
generalizations in history, social studies, 
or other fields from local and familiar instances. But such illustrations presuppose 
a sound investigation of the local data in 
relation to the general findings of a discipline; and if such an investigation is 
made, its result is more than an item of 
teaching materials; it is, in fact, an additional datum in the inductive structure 
of the discipline itself. 

The present generation should not 
be surprised at the conclusion that a technological revolution has in it the seeds of 
a cultural revolution. Such may indeed be 
true in this instance. The cultural revival of the small town as against the monopoly of the metropolis, and the democratization {% include pagebreak.html canvas=372 %} and "deprofessionalization" of scholarship 
are on the horizon which seems to lie 
ahead. And these things, themselves, accord with other elements of our social and 
economic prospects---notably the possible 
decline in the centralization of population in cities and the development of a {% include columnbreak.html canvas=372 col=2 %} new leisure in the hands of a well-educated people. The same technical innovations that promise to give aid to the research worker in his cubicle may also 
lead the whole population toward participation in a new cultural design.
