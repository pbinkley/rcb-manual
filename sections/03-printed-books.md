 {% include pagebreak.html canvas=31 %} The publishers of commercially successful books have very little occasion to 
study the cost curve of editions in the 
range of 50 to 500, this range 
in edition size that library demand and 
scholarly interest indicate as the most important in the reproduction of research materials. The cost curve behaves very 
strangely in this zone, so that the judgment of busines men acquainted with large-edition printing may be of little value 
here. How can these costs be analyzed most 
clearly, and the respective places of the 
various techniques of book production determined? 

The stages of book production separate costs into three primary elements: a 
"first cost," incurred regardless of the 
size of the edition; a "running cost," 
varying with the size of edition; and a 
"reprint cost," incurred when an edition is 
exhausted and a new printing made from 
plates. The reprint cost is independent of 
the size of the reprint edition; it is a 
kind of second "first cost," followed by a 
running cost that varies with the size of 
edition. 

The first cost is itself divisible
into two very important elements: composition costs, here defined as all costs that 
vary with the number of words; and area 
costs, which are those that vary with the 
area of paper used in a single copy. Composition costs are found in typewriting 
and linotyping; area costs are found in 
some of the pressroom operations. To print 
in large type rather than in small affects 
principally area costs, not composition 
costs, because it means spreading the same 
number of words over more paper; to reproduce by photolithography is to render area 
costs paramount elements of first cost. Reprint costs are affected in printing by
storing type (rates running around $.01 per 
page per month), or by making stereotypes 
and electrotypes; in photo-offset, by saving the metal sheets; in 
mimeographing, by {% include columnbreak.html canvas=31 col=2 %} saving the stencils. 

The librarian receives as a book 
any bound volume, however it may have been 
manufactured. Library shelves give their 
space to many bound volumes of photostated 
pages (mostly copies of rare books) and 
many bound volumes of typescript (mostly 
theses). Occasionally a bound volume produced by the mimeograph finds its way to 
the shelves. In recent years there have 
been a number of books produced by the 
photo-offset method from typescript master 
copies. Many reprints of old books are 
manufactured by photo-offset. Such parvenu 
volumes, invading the library shelves, are 
regarded with no little contempt by the exponents of established printing press products already in possession. How far are 
these different techniques suitable for the 
production of books? How is the field to 
be allotted among them? 

Here it is necessary to note that 
the book itself is challenged, even in the 
library. The vertical file, housing an array of unbound memoranda, pamphlets, propaganda matter, broadsides, and other materials, some of permanent value and some 
ephemeral, has come into the library reference room to take business away from the 
bookshelves. And now from another quarter 
comes the possible development of reduced 
copies on film of material to be read by 
projection, threatening the books with more 
serious technological unemployment. Not 
only the ordinary printed book of the conventional form, but even the book itself is 
placed in a competitive position where it 
once possessed a monopoly. It will require 
no little care to make sure that competition between the book and its rivals is 
regulated in the best interests of scholarship.

The starting point of an analysis 
of the technological problem of book production is a fundamental distinction to be 
made between two types of cost behavior, 
instanced by the photostat on the one hand, {% include pagebreak.html canvas=32 %} the printing press on the other. When copies are multiplied by the photostat or in 
miniature film copies, no matter how large 
the edition, the cost per copy stands constant. The element of "first cost" is absent; running costs alone prevail. This 
was the cost situation of all multiplying 
of writing before Gutenberg. The invention of printing introduced a situation in
which the cost per copy fell as the size of 
the edition increased. For purposes of 
convenience all those techniques which operate on a cost system resembling printing 
will be analyzed first, and those techniques which operate on or near a pre-Gutenberg cost basis will be analyzed later. 

Of the techniques operating on the 
system resembling printing (i.e., with a 
substantial distinction between first costs 
and running costs), several classifications 
are possible. The one that will probably 
appeal to scholars as the most natural 
would distinguish between those techniques 
which produce a book printed in the kind of 
book type with which they are familiar, and 
those which produce a book printed in typescript. 

Of the techniques yielding a product in print-face type, there are two that 
are available for putting new material into 
book form: these are printing from raised 
type on a flat-bed cylinder press, and 
printing from raised type on a multigraphing machine. Two other techniques are 
available for making new books from photographs of old ones. These are the photo-offset method, which has many names,[^n1] and 
the "dermaprint" method. The photo-offset 
process works from a negative photographic 
copy to a metal printing surface, the dermaprint from a positive photographic copy to 
a mimeograph stencil surface. 

[^n1]: Planographing (which includes hectographing), photolithography, lithoprinting, offset printing, "copifyer" process, rotaprinting, offset lithography, repro-printing, photocopying, photoprinting, poly-printing, planoprinting, and multilithing. 

There are also four techniques for 
making books in typescript face. Among 
them the leading place belongs to photo-offset, but room must also be found for the 
mimeograph, hectograph, and even the humble carbon paper. These techniques will be 
discussed in a later chapter. This present analysis is limited to the discussion 
of making books in ordinary print type from {% include columnbreak.html canvas=32 col=2 %} one of two kinds of copy---a manuscript that 
is being converted into a new book, and an 
old book that is being reprinted. 

## Printing with Raised Type on Cylinder Presses 

From the time of John Gutenberg until that of Ottmar Mergenthaler, the process of printing remained fundamentally the 
same. Separate types, laboriously set up 
by hand, were used to make impressions 
upon paper or other substances. With the 
invention of the typesetting and typecasting machines in the nineteenth century,
however, a revolution in printing methods 
was effected. 

The most common typesetting 
machines, remarkable in their ingenious 
mechanism, are the linotype, invented by 
Mergenthaler, and the intertype, built upon 
the mechanical principles devised by him. 
These machines, which produce the greater 
percentage of composition in this country,
assemble matrices containing the faces of 
letters in intaglio at the side of a mold, 
in which is cast the complete line in one 
piece or slug, with the type on the upper 
edge, properly spaced and justified. The 
Ludlow Typograph, another slug-casting machine, is used chiefly for display work. 
The monotype, invented by Tolbert Lanston, 
casts individual types in the correct order 
and automatically transfers them to a galley in justified lines. 

The type as cast by the compositor 
is arranged in long columns. These must 
be proofread and "made-up," that is to say, 
divided into pages and arranged in forms 
in such a way that the printed sheet, when 
folded, will page correctly. 

The printing is then done on a 
flat-bed cylinder press. The type as laid 
on the flat surface, with its thousands of 
slugs and individual types, does not present a true surface, It is, therefore, 
necessary to prepare the surface of the 
printing machine cylinder (called the tym- 
pan sheet) so that even pressure is given 
on every part on the type. This operation 
which is a most laborious affair if conscientiously done, is called "make-ready." 
Without careful make-ready, satisfactory

## Printing: Composition Costs 

In printing from raised type on 
flat-bed cylinder presses, composition 
costs form a major item of expense in the 
manufacture of a book. To be sure, the 
composing machines, by increasing the speed 
and accuracy of composition, have reduced 
its cost, so that hand-set type, when used 
in straight textual matter, has become a 
luxury. But the elaborate mechanism necessary for casting type makes the cost of 
the machines so high (from $4000 to $8000) 
that a heavy overhead charge is necessary. 
The all-inclusive cost per chargeable hour 
for the operation of the machines range 
from $3.00 to $5.00. The composite average for print shops in the United States in 
1932 was $3.927, according to the United 
Typothetae of America. The composite for 
monotype keyboard operation was $3.466, and 
for the monotype caster $2.858. These figures include all factory expenses, commercial and selling expenses, overhead, and 
the wages of skilled compositors, which 
form 45% of the total. In estimating 
cost of composition, a standard unit of 
1000 ems is used; that is, the amount of 
text that will occupy the lineage of a 
thousand of the letter *m*, or, to be more 
accurate, the square of any particular type 
size. If the number of ems per word is 
calculated at four, there would be 250 
words per 1000 ems. Since a compositor 
will set from 3000 to 5000 ems per hour, 
the cost of machine composition, reckoning 
on the basis of $3.00 to $5.00 per machine 
hour, would run between $2.40 and $6.65 per 
1000 words. 

Theoretically, the amount of composition is determined by multiplying the 
number of ems in one line by the number of 
lines set. It is the general trade practice, however, in measuring up type for the 
purpose of finding the cost of composition, 
to include headings, leads, slugs, etc., as 
composed lines.[^n2] Thus the number of ems in 
the page is found by multiplying the width 
by the length of the line. The author, 
therefore, pays in composition for excessive leading. 
The majority of books appear in 10-point type on 11-point body, the {% include columnbreak.html canvas=39 col=2 %} majority of newspapers in 6½-point or 
7-point type on 7-point body. For each additional point of leading the author ordinarily pays about 10% more in composition. 
It is questionable whether legibility demands more than one point of lead between 
lines. Certainly types like Caslon Old 
Style, with its long descenders, can be 
sparsely leaded without suffering in legibility.

[^n2]: Some firms, like R. R. Donnelley and Sons Company, have adopted the scientific method of measuring composition by computing the actual number of ems set. 

Composition costs can be controlled 
in some measure by using a compact type 
face. Most of the commonly used type faces, 
like Caslon Old Style, Scotch Roman and Modern, have a set corresponding to the face 
size, that is, an em of these type faces is 
square; others, like Binny Old Style and 
Century Expanded, are used at a slightly 
wider set; while others, like Bruce Old 
Style, Kennerley, Garamond, and Granjon, are 
cast on a slightly narrower set. Thus a 
page of a certain number of ems of Granjon 
would contain 7% to 10% more words than a 
corresponding page with the same number of 
ems of Century Expanded, as is obvious by 
comparing the word content of Figure I. 
Two economical print-face formats are shown 
in figures II and III.

The difference in words per 1000 
ems between a compact and expanded type 
face, plus the difference between minimal 
and excessive leading, may make an appreciable difference in composition costs for 
a book of a few hundred pages, perhaps as 
much as 10% or 20%. 

Most of the printing done in America is newsprinting. The American public 
reads more words in newsprint than in any 
other form. The publication of scholarly 
books, if estimated in number of ems, or 
area of pages, or tonnage of paper and size 
of edition, is almost negligible in comparison with the corresponding newsprint figures. Yet books, in general, are printed 
in larger type than newspapers, and with a 
layout that devotes a much larger proportion of the page area to margins. Newsprint in two-inch columns, as standardized 
in the American press, is certainly a format of remarkable cheapness and efficiency. 

As a factor increasing composition 
costs, corrections and alterations deserve 
particular attention. From a description {% include pagebreak.html canvas=40 %} of the typesetting machines, especially the 
linotype and intertype, it is obvious that 
making corrections in the matter already 
set up is a costly operation, because each 
error requires the substitution of an en- 
tire line. With the monotype, corrections 
are somewhat cheaper, for only a single 
letter, already cast, need be substituted. 

After composition has been made to 
correspond to the copy, all changes subsequently made by the author or his publisher, whether in the text or in the arrangement of paragraphs, are considered as 
author's alterations and are charged 
against him. Not infrequently the author 
is presented with a bill for his alterations almost equaling that of the original 
composition costs. Author's alterations 
are usually charged on the basis of time 
at the rate of about $2.00 to $4.00 per 
hour, varying with the wage scale, and 
higher when made by machine than when made 
by hand. In some cases alterations are 
billed on a unit basis with standard unit 
prices for changes, which enable the customer to check his bill. In some cases a 
free allowance, possibly 10% above the 
original composition, is made by the printer for author's alterations, which means 
simply that this factor has been figured 
into the original bid. 

Author's corrections would be entirely unnecessary if the author would devote the same attention to the preparation 
of copy as he would to making a master copy 
for photo-offset, and be equally satisfied 
to accept this as a final form. By deliberately preparing a manuscript which would 
justify the instruction to "follow copy,"
the author would contribute to a low cost 
level in ordinary printing in the same way, 
though in a less degree, as by taking upon 
himself the making of the master copy for 
the photo-offset process. Some editors affirm that authors are so given to habits of 
carelessness that reform in this respect is 
possible only by changing human nature. 

## Printing: Area Costs 

As in the case of composition costs, 
it is difficult for the author to control
area costs in raised type printing. Area 
costs consist of make-up and make-ready. 
These operations increase in cost with the 
number of pages, but also greatly increase 
whenever it is necessary to fit type around {% include columnbreak.html canvas=40 col=2 %} pictorial or non-textual matter during 
make-up, or whenever the tympan sheet on 
the press must be prepared for pictorial 
matter during make-ready. 

The fundamental unit of all area 
costs in raised type printing is the form 
or signature. The form is the area of 
type that fills the bed of the press, and 
is imposed upon the paper in one printing 
operation. The signature is the sheet of 
paper, printed on both sides, which is 
folded into a definite number of pages---usually sixteen or thirty-two. The area 
costs of printing mount form by form and 
signature by signature. It is wasteful of 
area to utilize only a portion of a form 
or to leave part of a signature unprinted. 
Printing economy always requires that there 
be such a calculation of type face, type
size, and leading that the text comes out 
even with the forms and signatures. Just 
as ems, not words, are the main cost units 
in composition, so forms and signatures, 
not pages, are the determining quantities 
in area costs.

The amount of space a manuscript 
will occupy can be calculated either by 
counting the number of words in a suffcient number of lines and then multiplying 
by the number of lines, or by figuring the 
number of letters or words to the square 
inch. The average typewriter, with pica 
type, writes sixty letters single-spaced 
and thirty letters double-spaced; and with 
elite type writes seventy-two letters single-spaced and thirty-six letters double-spaced to the square inch. The average 
print-face type, on the other hand, has 
approximately the following number of letters to the square inch: 

| Size of Type | Solid | Leaded | 
|------:|------:|------:|
| 6-point | 204 | 153 |
| 8-point | 153 | 119 |
| 1O-point | 98 | 84 |
| 12-point | 72 | 60 |

The average print-face type, moreover, has 
approximately the following number of words 
to the square inch: 

| Size of Type | Solid | Leaded | 
|------:|------:|------:|
| 6-point | 47 | 34 |
| 8-point | 32 | 23 |
| 10-point | 21 | 16 |
| 12-point | 14 | 11 |

{% include figure.html fig="04" %}

{% include pagebreak.html canvas=43 %} The number of pages, and hence the number 
of forms, required will vary with the point 
size of the type, the compactness of the 
type, and the amount of leading. 

An important difference is to be 
noted in the effect upon costs of faces 
and compactness of type on the one hand, 
and point, size on the other. True it is 
that resort to compact type faces and light 
leading will mean fewer pages and hence 
fewer forms than extended faces and heavy 
leading. But the greatest difference in 
area costs is a resultant of two other factors---the proportion of paper given to text 
as compared with the proportion given to 
margins, and the point size of type. These 
elements of cost, more than any others, are 
likely to be related most directly to the 
beauty and legibility of text.

According to Vernon,[^n3] there is no 
great variation in legibility between 6-point type and 10-point type. Readers and 
reviewers, however, often express preference for the larger type sizes, and their 
preferences, even if they be regarded as 
the results of habit rather than the consequences of the physiology of vision, must 
be taken into account by a publisher. How 
far it is wise to let considerations of 
economy in area costs bring about the use 
of the smaller type sizes must be calculated by comparing two quantities: namely, 
the percentage of cost saving that can be 
effected by shifting from the largest to 
the smallest type, and the sacrifice of 
legibility or beauty that results from such 
a shift.

[^n3]: M. D. Vernon, *Experimental Study of Reading*, (Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1931). 

How rapidly will area costs fall if 
type size is reduced? Consider a 6″ x 9″ 
page, with a printing surface 4½″ 
x 7½″, printed with 32-page forms. Newsprint in two columns with half an inch between them would yield 800 pages, 24,600 
words per form (according to an actual 
count of words). Eight-point type, leaded 
one point would put 25,000 words on a form; 
100-point type in the same type face, leaded one point, would put 17,500 words on a 
form. Figure IV shows the increase in word 
content per page that is made possible by 
shifting from 10-point Bodoni type to 8-point Bodoni, both being leaded one point. 
The shift from 10-point to 8-point type 
would save one form out of three, or one-{%- include columnbreak.html canvas=43 col=2 -%}third of the area cost in a text of 50,000 
words.

## Printing: Running Costs 

Running costs are not decisive in 
small editions. The difference between 
the cost of printing 50 and 100 copies is
so small that firms often quote the same 
price for both. It is thus possible to
have an overprint, which can be left in 
sheets until needed, at a very slight additional cost. Even with books of larger 
editions this procedure is followed. The 
*Encyclopedia Britannica*, for example, is 
printed in lots of 15,000, but is bound in 
lots of 2500 only. Electrotypes are made 
which are preserved for further printing, 
and the type is kept standing for making 
corrections and for making new electrotypes. 

As the size of the edition increases 
to the point where composition and make-ready costs begin to be balanced by the 
cost of materials and running time in the 
press, the established conceptions covering 
book costs become operative. Many of the 
great inventions in the printing world 
since the Linotype have been devices of one 
kind or another for getting the printing 
surface on a cylinder and off the flat-bed, 
so that faster running and longer runs 
would be possible. This is the story of 
the stereotype, cast from a matrix, and of 
the electrotype, resulting from coating an 
impression in wax electrolytically with 
copper. But they have no place in the calculations of costs of small editions. 

## Printing: Analysis of Costs 

In analyzing the composition, the 
area, and the running costs for producing 
a book by straight printing, one might 
take the cost behavior in Chicago as an example. A book of 50,000 words in an edition Of 250, on 128 6″ x 9″ pages, could be 
made for $246.57. Taking these figures as 
an illustrative sample, it appears that for 
composing and printing a book, about 50% 
of the cost goes for composition, about 
32% for make-up, 12% for make-ready, and 
6% for actual printing in a minimum edition. 
There is, however, great dissimilarity in 
the amount which the different departments 
contribute to the cost of the finished 
product in various shops of the country, {% include pagebreak.html canvas=44 %} 

| For hour costs of composing 50,000 words at a composite rate of $3.55 per hour for Chicago printers, without allowance for profit, the total would be ... | $127.50 | 
| For hour costs of printing 250 impressions, the time allowed per form being .35 ours: according to Hoch,[^n4] or a total of 2.80 hours, at a composite rate of $4.90 per hour for flat-bed cylinder presses for Chicago printers, without allowance for profit, the total would be ... | 13.72 |
| For wages at the prevailing rate of $1.225 per hour in 1922 for make-up and lock-up, the time required for eight 16-page forms being 64 hours, the total wage bill would be ... | 78.40 | 
| For wages at the prevailing rate of $1.225 per hour in 1933 for make-ready, the time required for a book of 128 pages, for which eight forms of 16 pages would be necessary, a deduction of .5 hours from the first make-ready time of 3.5 hours being allowed for the seven repetitive forms, the time required being 22 hours, the total wage bill would be ... | 26.95 |
| | $246.57 |

In general, the wages paid to low-wage 
skilled labor for composition work and for 
make-up and make-ready must account for a 
large part of the printer's bill. The averages of the United Typothetae of America 
show that wages account for approximately 
45% of the cost of printing. Wages constantly increase in proportion to the total cost of production as the size of the 
edition decreases. The printing and publishing business, which is under the same 
pressure as other industries toward decentralization away from the big cities, can 
be expected to decentralize most rapidly 
its small-edition publishing. There is 
now setting in a contrary pressure toward 
the standardization of wages, but unless 
the regional and urban-rural differentials 
are closed up, small-edition publishing {% include columnbreak.html canvas=44 col=2 %} can be expected to drift to the 
areas. 

## The Multigraph Process 

In multigraphing, the scholar encounters the curious situation that while 
he is trying to find an economical means of 
making small runs that will look like printing rather than typescript, the business 
man is trying to make large runs that will 
look like typescript rather than print. The 
multigraph (Figure V) is a small rotary 
printing machine designed for office use 
and employed chiefly for printing form letters and circulars of one or more pages in 
imitation of typescript and for making office forms from print-face type in imitation of printing.[^n5] 

[^n4]: Fred Hoch, *Standard Book of Estimating for Printers* (Chicago, 1929) issued by the United Typothetae of America. 

[^n5]: Loose type, milled linotype slugs, special monotype composition, automatically embossed aluminum type 
    strips or curved plates or electrotypes are mounted on the printing cylinder by sliding them into 
    fixed grooves. Loose type, which is the most commonly used, is set semi-automatically by hand or with 
    a typesetting machine operated with typewriter control. As in the case of typewriting, the right-hand 
    margins come out uneven, unless they are justified by hand or with special adjustable spacers. The 
    type is obtainable in a wide variety of sizes and standard print-faces, and costs $.80 for typewriter 
    styles, $.95 for print styles, for a box containing on an average 25,000 characters, printing about 
    415 words; it is scrapped after using. It is sometimes mounted on a flexible blanket which may easily 
    be attached to or removed from a smooth-faced segment. The embossed strips are always mounted on a 
    similar sort of blanket. The most popular multigraph prints only one 8½″ x 11″ page at a time, but 
    a machine is manufactured with a drum large enough for two 8½″ x 11″ pages; this is fairly common. 
  
The best adaptation of multigraph

{% include figure.html fig="08-09" %}
{% include figure.html fig="10" %}

 {% include pagebreak.html canvas=51 %} printing to the purpose of book production 
has been made by the Mimeoform Service under the direction of Dr. Ernest Kletsch, 
who styles his process the mimeoform process.[^n6] He uses a Lanston Monotype for setting the type, which is cast in a low type 
mold, 8-, 10-, or 12-point. A special 
caster (the only part of his equipment that 
may not be found in almost any establishment supplying multigraph shops with composition) automatically delivers the line of 
short type, properly spaced and justified, 
to the channels of the multigraph drum. 
When the drum is filled, the caster automatically stops. It takes only half a minute to fit the drum to the multigraph machine, and the printing can begin. Proofreading is done immediately, and corrections are quickly made from the case of type. 

[^n6]: Other names for similar multigraph services are Mimeo-Gravure and Mimeo-Photo. 

There are certain defects in the 
appearance of the finished mimeoform product. Within the range of type sizes from 
6-point to 12-point, all the type faces 
available for monotype composition are 
available for multigraph composition, and 
pages are produced by the multigraph with 
all the features of print-face, such as 
Justified lines, italics, bold-face, etc. 
But the appearance of the printed page 
sometimes displays certain imperfections. 
As the type is transferred to the channels 
of the drum, it occasionally slips up or 
down or slightly awry. This results not 
only in a poor alignment of type, but in 
some cases in an indistinct impression. In 
general, the product of the mimeoform does 
not approach the highest quality of the 
flat-bed cylinder press. 

A limitation in format is also to
be noticed. The space between the channels 
on the multigraph drum, into which the 
short type is transferred by the caster, is 
fixed, permitting not more than six lines 
to the inch, regardless of size of type. 
Thus all four type sizes available (6-, 8-, 
10-, and 12-point) are cast on a 12-point 
body (note Figure VI, set in 12-point and 
8-point type). This means that lines of {% include columnbreak.html canvas=51 col=2 %} 10-point type, the most commonly used for 
book composition, would be leaded two 
points; 8-point type, four points; and 6-point type, used for footnotes, six points. 
For spacing between paragraphs, a channel 
of the drum would be left empty. In 10- 
point composition the loss in compactness 
over ordinary composition leaded one point 
is about 30%, and this percentage increases 
as the size of the type decreases. The waste 
of space is particularly great in footnote 
work. The effect of this wastage of paper 
area can be neutralized by using the full 
surface of the drum and printing upon a 
large page, 8½" x 11". Running costs 
are the same for this large page as for a 
smaller one, and indeed, in the writer's 
opinion, the best possible format for mimeoform work is an 8½" x 11" page set in 
10-point type in two columns (Figure VII).
 
One further limitation of the multigraph as a book-printing device must be 
mentioned: it is quite unsuited to any 
publishing in which illustrative material 
is to be put on the same page with textual 
matter. Although it is possible to incorporate line cuts or coarse screen half 
tones in a page of matter produced on the 
multigraph by purchasing small curved electrotypes of the illustrative material, the 
cost is such that it is more economical to 
use some other process---e.g., photo-offset---for highly illustrated text. On the 
other hand, if illustrations are on separate pages, the multigraph is well suited 
to their use, because they do not have to 
be interleaved in signatures but can be 
gathered for binding like any other pages. 

The mimeoform process of multigraph 
printing is useful for the production of 
scholarly books when the edition is in the 
region of 100 to 500. Considerable savings over. ordinary printing are here effected because composition costs are reduced, in some measure, by wage-scale factors and by the very difficulty of making 
author's corrections which tends to enforce upon authors practices that would be 
equally effective in reducing printing costs.[^n7] {% include pagebreak.html canvas=52 %} Area costs are held down because make-up is 
eliminated, being combined with typesetting, 
and because there is no make-ready, and it 
is in area costs that the principal savings 
occur. Running costs are higher in proportion than printing press running costs because each page is run separately; for that 
reason, printing will always catch up with 
and pass mimeoform, if the edition is large 
enough; but in the region of 100 to S00, 
running costs are so small a part of the total costs that the economy of the flat-bed 
press in printing sixteen pages at a time {% include columnbreak.html canvas=52 col=2 %} is of small importance. 

[^n7]: The multigraph interferes somewhat with the working habit of scholars who expect to receive proofs of 
    a 300-page book, leave them on the desk for a week, and correct them when they "get to it." The 
    Mimeoform Service does not at present have the equipment for holding so many pages in type pending submission of the proof to and by the author, and the office routine is based on the assumption that the proofreader alone, not the author, will be responsible for final correction. The situation could be 
    changed by an extension of equipment and a change of routine. 
    The effect of the change would be a 
    slight increase in costs. 
  
The following figures show the com- 
parative prices of mimeoform and flat-bed 
cylinder publication, and show the mimeoform process lowest in cost as a means of 
presenting straight textual matter in print-face type in small editions. The advantage of the mimeoform fades out when the 
size of the edition passes the 600 mark. 
The costs per page as here quoted in 1934 
are within the range of those that Bean 
found normal in 1927---from $2.25 to $4.00.

## Alternatives to Printing 

This is the cost picture that printing presents to the scholar. If the problems of scholarly publishing are not met at 
this cost level, the alternative to be studied is the use of typescript reproduced by 
photo-offset, the mimeograph or hectograph, 
or by some photographic process. Of these, 
photo-offset is the most frequently applied 
to book production. The first use of these 
processes is found in bringing back into 
print materials already available in printed form; but they can also be used for publishing new matter from typescript. However, these processes can be most clearly 
analyzed as devices for reprinting, and 
they will therefore be described in that 
connection. 

## Reprinting: the Photo-offset Process 

The process known as photolithography, photo-offset, lithoprinting, offset 
printing, planograph printing, and a number 
of trade or firm names, has developed in 
the last thirty years from the combined application of the principles of lithography 
and photography, together with a new type 
of printing press. 

Lithography was developed by applying the principle that grease repels water, 
but attracts a greasy ink. The process was 
discovered in 1796 by Alois Senefelder of 
Munich, who used the limestone of Solenhofen, Bavaria, which was especially good 
for absorbing water and taking grease. A 
stone surface was covered with the greasy 
marks of a lithographic pencil, then moistened and then inked. The ink would adhere 
to the pencil marks, avoid the moistened 
spaces, and transfer to paper as a lithographic print. This direct method from 
stone to paper necessitated the image to be 
drawn or imposed on the stone in reverse. 

The same principle is applied in 
the photo-offset process, which is fundamentally lithographic in character. A photographic image is transferred, via a negative, to a metal plate covered with a light-{%- include columnbreak.html canvas=59 col=2 -%}sensitive emulsion (albumen with ammonium 
bichromate). An exposure to an arc light 
hardens the portions of the emulsion under 
the transparent parts of the negative so 
that they remain on the plate after development as an image of the copy to be reproduced. Thus, the process is photographic. A 
sample sheet of the negative (Figure VIII) 
and a sample piece of a used metal sheet 
from the multilith (Figure IX) are bound 
herewith. 

The emulsion image is of such a 
character that it is receptive to greasy 
ink. The plate, therefore, may be placed 
upon a press which moistens it (the moisture adheres to the parts of the plate not 
carrying the hardened emulsion) and inks it 
(the greasy ink avoids the moistened surfaces of the plate, but sticks to the emulsion image). The printing surface is flat; 
it has no raised surfaces like type faces, 
no sunken intaglios; hence the name "planographic."

The third element of the process is 
the offset press. The first practical offset press, upon which flat-surface metal 
plates could be used, was developed in 1906. A few years earlier Ira W. Rubel, a 
lithographer of Nutley, New Jersey, conceived the idea of developing an offset 
press while watching a feeder operate a 
cylinder press. When the feeder missed a 
sheet, as sometimes happens, there was 
made on the tympan sheet an impression 
which offset on the back of the next sheet 
and produced a better print than the one 
Rubel was getting by direct impression. He 
thereupon developed an offset press in 
which a reversed image was printed by the 
flat-surfaced plate on a rubber blanket, 
from which the wet impression was offset on 
the paper sheet. It is this last feature 
which has given the whole process its name 
of "offset printing."[^n8] 

[^n8]: The two elements of the process---the photographic preparation of a metal printing surface and the use 
    of a rubber blanket to "offset" the impression---are not necessarily and indissolubly connected. 
    There is one press, the Schwarze Presse or Coxhead Press, which brings the metal printing surface directly 
    in contact with the paper. 
    It is planographic in the sense that the printing surface is a plane, 
    photographic in that the surface is prepared by photographic means, but it is not an offset process. 
    The Schwarze or Coxhead process also differs from most planographic processes in that no negative is 
    used in transferring an image to the metal. 
    A drawing is laid directly on the sensitized metal and 
    the image burned with an arc light. 
    This process has its place, particularly in the multiplying of 
    architects' drawings, but no extended analysis of it is required here. 
  
For scholarly publication, two 
small offset presses, the "rotaprint" and 
the multilith (Figures X and XI), which 
are used by business offices doing small {% include pagebreak.html canvas=60 %} runs of advertising matter or publishing a 
house organ, deserve special attention. 
When soliciting business, the users of the 
large offset presses regard these smaller 
units as little better than office appliances; the users of the small presses challenge this judgment. But in the presence 
of the NRA the large offset press people 
tried to make rotaprint and multilith come 
into the Graphic Arts Code, while they held 
out on the claim of being merely office appliances. Examples of their work will enable the reader to judge of their relative 
quality (see Figures XXV and XXVI in Chapter V). This volume is planographed with a Harris press (Figure XII), which has also 
been used in reproducing pictures in the 
chapter on illustrations. 

## Photo-Offset: Composition Costs 

The composition of the text from 
which the photographic negative is produced 
is not actually part of the photo-offset 
process: in preparing a new book by photo-offset, either ordinary raised type composition or typewriting would be used, and 
the factors affecting these costs are elsewhere discussed. If ordinary linotype composition were resorted to with this process, no saving would be possible unless a 
considerable number of illustrations appeared; the production of typescript books 
by photo-offset will be examined in Chapter 
V. 

In the present discussion photo-offset is being considered as a reprinting 
device, and in the case of a reprint of a 
book by this process, there is actually no 
composition whatever, the old book serving 
as master copy for the photographic part of 
the process. 

## Photo-Offset: Area Costs 

In the photo-offset process cost 
behavior is controlled by the fact that 
first costs in the shop are essentially 
area costs. It is to the area costs, that 
is, to the preparation of the photographic 
negative and to the making of the metal 
plates, that chief attention must be devot- 
ed. 

### (a) The Photographic Negative 

In the preparation of the photographic negative, various kinds of materi{%- include columnbreak.html canvas=60 col=2 -%}als can be used. The photo-offset process 
was originally developed with wet-plate 
photography. This technique came to the 
photo-offset shop from the photoengraver. 
The photoengraver would coat a sheet of 
glass with albumen, collodion, and nitrate 
of silver in the order named, thus making a 
"wet plate." This wet plate would go into 
the camera and be developed and fixed as a 
photographic negative. It would then have 
its surface strengthened by applications of 
a liquid rubber solution and collodion. The 
result would be a "sandwich" of the photo- 
graphic silver image between two sheets of 
collodion adhering to the glass plate. Then 
the photoengraver would soak off the sand- 
wich with a bath of acetic acid and use it 
as a negative in preparing the metal sheet 
printing surface. More recently it has become the practice to use film rather than 
wet plate at this stage of the process, and 
now paper negative is taking the place of 
film for some kinds of work. The cost relationships of these three photographic 
media are approximately: 

| Paper negative ... | 1 |
| Film negative ... | 3 |
| Wet plate ... | 6 |

When the material to be copied is of maximum legibility, with ample contrast between 
its black and white, the paper negative 
(Photostat N-26, Kodalith, Contrasto Polygraphic Company's product or Haloid Company's Litholoid) is wholly satisfactory. 
According to an estimate made for the Joint 
Committee, the paper negatives required in 
preparing metal sheets for a book of 128 
pages, 6″ x 9″, would cost $5.12. If film 
were used, the cost of the films would be 
$17.92. Thus a variation of $12.80, or approximately 10% of a job priced at about 
$125.00 (exclusive of binding and paper 
costs) is controlled by the choice of film 
or paper negatives. On the other hand, 
when the copy is poor the photo-offset 
printer may be forced to use a wet plate 
negative.[^n9]

[^n9]: The Typary and Typon Company, 1--4 Red Lion Passage, Fleet Street, London, England, manufactures a 
    "stripping paper." It resembles Kodalith paper except that the thin emulsion can be 
    stripped dry off the paper base and transferred to the metal for the burning—in process. 
    The emulsion stripped from the stripping paper is so much thinner than film or Kodalith paper that it is said to 
    make a clearer image in the burning-in process and is therefore comparable to the wet plate in fineness. 
    This paper is available in Germany at the firms of von Bayer in Leverkusen, Koln; the Mimosa— 
    A.G., Dresden, Schandauerstrasse; the Baltische Papier-fabrik, Berlin, N. W. 7, Dorotheenstrasse 38.
     
    The typon paper can also be used for making negatives for photo-offset work without photographic apparatus, as in reflection copying; the paper is laid on top of the original to be copied, exposed 
    10--20 seconds, developed by means of a special developer, and fixed, as usual. After drying, the emulsion is stripped from a stripping paper. 
    Through this process the cost of the negatives is considerably reduced. 
    Many books such as lexicons, law books, etc., are printed by this method. 
    
    Photographic apparatus is being manufactured by Hoh un Hahne of Leipzig, Germany, which will 
    produce negatives of book pages for photo-offset work at a great speed: it is apparatus with self-acting bellows or dark slide, automatic shutters for exposure, and devices for the proper pagination 
    and placing of the book. 
  
It sometimes happens that there 
will be no way of bringing the original 
copy of the book to be reproduced to the 
photo-offset printer. In such a case, a 
skilled photostat operator or commercial 
photographer, acting under instructions 

{% include figure.html fig="12" %}

{% include pagebreak.html canvas=63 %} 

given him for the purpose, can prepare the 
paper negatives. The situation may bring 
about a separation of the photographic costs 
from the strictly photo-offset costs. The 
trade does not usually work on this basis, 
but figures received from several sources 
indicate that a discount of 18% to 30% can 
be given if satisfactory paper negatives 
are provided to the photolithographer.[^n10]
Another basis for calculating this cost is 
found in the difference between the original and reprint quotations when the photolithographer has preserved the negatives 
for the book, but not the metal sheets. 
This discount when given runs near to 15%. 

[^n10]:  Figured on basis of quotations given for producing a book of 128 pages, 6″ x 9″, in an edition of fifty, 
    exclusive of paper and bindipoong costs. 

### (b) The Preparation of the Metal Plate 

However, in computing area costs, 
the preparation of the metal plate is a 
more important factor than the making of 
the photographic negatives. The price per {% include columnbreak.html canvas=63 col=2 %} area of photo-offset printing surface has 
been calculated by Fred W. Hoch, author of 
the *Standard Book of Estimating for Printers*, and published in the *American Printer* 
for June, 1932 (p. 55), as follows. According to information recently received, these 
prices hold today. From these figures it
appears that the price of photo-offset 
printing surface should be somewhere be- 
tween $2.14 and $2.41 per 100 square inches. 
These figures agree roughly with those obtained from certain firms in 1933 and with 
quotations obtained in 1931. 

### (c) Full Utilization of Metal Plate Surface
 
Since the printing surface of the 
metal plates constitutes the most important 
factor in the determination of area costs, 
photo-offset work pages should be planned 
to use all of the surface of the sheets.

TABLE VI 

PRICES ON PHOTO-OFFSET PRINTING SURFACE 

| | First 100 Copies | Per Additional 100's |
|--------------|------:|------:|
| 8 1.2″ x 11″ | $2.00 | $0.30 | 
| 8½″ x 14″ | 2.75 | 0.40 | 
| 9½″ x 12″ | 2.75 | 0.40 |
| 11″ x 17″ | 4.00 | 0.60 |
| 14″ x 17″ | 5.50 | 0.80 |
| 12″ x 19″ | 5.50 | 0.80 |

| 17″ x 28″ | 11.00 | 1.40 |

| 22″ x 34″ | 16.00 | 2.40 |

 {% include pagebreak.html canvas=64 %} 

This raises the question of the relation of 
page, plate, and press sizes. 

There are on the market some eighty 
different sizes of offset presses, using 
metal sheets of eighty different dimensions. 
Yet such is the force and pressure of 
standardization in the trade that most operators will aver that all these variant 
sizes are best adapted to the two standard 
page sizes, 6″ x 9″, and 5½″ x 8½″ 
(and its double, 8½″ x 11″). These are, 
in fact, the page sizes that will divide 
most evenly into the standard cuts of book 
paper and bond paper. They are convenient, 
but they may turn out to be wasteful. 

For example, the rotaprint metal 
sheet, now officially known as Rotaplate, 
measures 11″ x 17″. It will take perfectly two pages of normal typewriter size paper, 8½″ x 11″. A working margin of 
½″ may be needed. But suppose a book of 
6″ x 9″ should be run on this press. No
less than 42% of the available printing 
surface would be wasted. In printing a 
book of 128 pages, 6″ x 9″) on this machine, sixty-four plates would be required, 
for no more than two pages could go on each 
plate. At $1.50 a plate, the cost would be 
$96.00, and of this about 42%, or $40.00, 
is wasted. Whoever would print 6″ x 9″ 
pages should find a printer with another 
size of press. In bringing back into print
some old book that happens to be printed in 
large-size type, it might be advisable to 
reduce the size to one that will fit evenly, or with minimum wastage, on the metal 
sheet of the press that will be used on the 
job. 

### (d) Area Costs and Legibility 

The principle which permits this 
economy has wide application. Since the 
printing surface for the photo-offset process, is prepared. photographically, the material to be reproduced can be enlarged or 
reduced to any degree desired. The purchaser buys the use of a certain number of {% include columnbreak.html canvas=64 col=2 %} square inches of printing surface; it is 
almost immaterial to the printer what is 
contained within these dimensions. This 
opens the publisher to an interesting temptation. He can enormously reduce the cost 
of reproducing any given text by reducing 
the size of the print. If he cuts the 
print in half; he inereases fourfold the 
amount of printed matter on his area of 
metal. Thus, it has been proposed that the 
New York *Times* be issued in a half-size edition for permanent preservation. 

The ease with which photo-offset 
printers can enlarge or reduce the size of 
the matter they copy, taken in connection 
with the controlling position of area costs, 
gives to the problem of legibility a special importance. The size of the type-face 
can be fixed at any point, from microscopic 
to above normal, and while the diameter is 
shrinking in arithmetical series---1,2,3,4,---the cost of producing the copies is 
shrinking in geometrical series---2,4,8,16. 
This situation creates a temptation to pull 
the size of the print down to the lowest 
point of legibility. There would seem to 
be several thresholds: first, the limiting 
size of the type that can be read without 
special strain or attention (accordime to 
Vernon, it is 6-point type); below the 
there is perhaps the smallest type that can 
be read without the use of a reading glass; 
and below that, the lower limit of reading 
glass efficiency.[^n11] Efforts have been made 
to use photo-offset at all these levels. 
The Hispanic Society has reprinted a rare 
Spanish dictionary in a reduction to one-sixth (one-sixth of its original size.[^n12] The experiment of the New York *Times* with a miniature 
edition reduced 50% from 7-point type has 
been mentioned. These experiments together 
with others are appraised in Chapter X in 
connection with various optical devices for 
reading. For the present, it is necessary 
to collect such information as) may be available on the effect of photo-offset reductions of type upon legibility with the
naked eye. 

[^n11]: See table in Chapter X, page 116. 

[^n12]: "....the photographs used in reproducing the Covarrubias. *Tesoro de la lengua castellana. o espanola* 
    we beg to report that the photographs used in reproducing the Covarrubias were made at the Hispanic 
    Society. Each of the 1382 pages was photographed separately on a 5″ x 7″ panchromatic film, using an 
    apochromatic lens. Glossy prints of these negatives were mounted on sheets of cardboard, nine prints 
    to a sheet, and this material was sent to the Rudge Company for reproduction by the offset process. 
    The microphotographic reproduction contained 154 pages. 
    The reduction is six diameters to one." From 
    letter of the Hispanic Society of America to Robert Binkley, February 18, 1932. 

{% include figure.html fig="13" %}

{% include pagebreak.html canvas=67 %} The Joint Committee on Materials 
for Research secured the help of Professors 
Donald G. Paterson and Miles A. Tinker of 
the University of Minnesota in examining 
this problem. By a speed-of-reading test 
these scholars studied the legibility of 
mewsprint of normal size (7-point) and 
newsprint reduced to 80%, 50% and 30% of 
normal size. The result of their work is a 
curve of diminishing legibility, as shown 
in Figure XIII.

To summarize: the relationships of 
legibility, type size, and area cost in 
photo-offset are such that costs of multiplying materials by this method must always 
be reckoned to include the type size and 
legibility factor. Just as the scholar 
with a new book to be set up in type for 
the printer will find costs depending on 
the number of words in the book rather than 
the size of the letters, so the scholar 
with an old book to be copied by photo-offset will find the costs depending on 
the size of the letters rather than the 
number of words. 

## Photo-Offset: Reprint Economy 

An important cost element that must 
also be taken into account in evaluating 
the photo-offset process is that of reprint economy. The idea of "reprint economy" is one of basic importance in all publishing accountancy. It deserves, therefore, a close analysis. It has been shown
that publishing costs are of two kinds: 
first cost and running cost, and that the 
first cost is a composite of two elements, 
composition cost and area cost. If a book 
can be made to pay its way in an edition of 
2000, a reprint of the book, manufactured 
by the same process, could also be expected to pay its way provided 2000 new purchasers should appear after the exhaustion 
bf the first edition. The number of prospective readers that can make a first edition pay can always make a second edition 
pay. But under certain conditions, the 
number of readers required to make a second edition pay need not be as large as 
that required to make the first edition 
pay. This result will follow whenever some 
of the work that has been paid for, as the 
"first cost" of the first edition can be
held over and used again without additional cost in a second edition. The revolutionary importance of this element in the {% include columnbreak.html canvas=67 col=2 %} cost structure of text reproduction is realized most completely in microcopying, but 
the element is also present in relief 
printing and in photo-offset work. 

The printer from raised type can 
hold his type or change his form into an 
electrotype by printing it in wax and depositing electrolytic copper in the wax 
matrix. He can then preserve the electrotypes and make a second printing without 
incurring any composition costs. But electrotypes and stereotypes are almost out of 
the question except for large editions. The 
electrotype for a 6″ by 9″ page, in a book
of 128 straight-type pages, will cost approximately $1.50 a page unmounted, $2.00 
a page mounted. The corresponding photo-offset device is to preserve the metal 
sheets, protected with a coating of gum and 
ready for a second run.

Some firms do not save the metal 
sheets, but save rather the photographic 
negatives from which they were prepared. 
The policies of photo-offset companies differ in the matter of passing on to the consumer the reprint economies made possible 
by saving the metal sheet or negative. Some 
policies and economies are here described 
for purposes of illustration: 

*Edwards Brothers, Ann Arbor*. Preserves 
metal sheets free of charge. If cost of 
first run is $1.50 for first 100 copies, 
cost of second run will be $.83, a difference of almost 50%. 

*National Process Company, 75 Varick Street, 
New York*. Saves the metal sheet, charging 
$1.50 for cost of storing. This is usually a sheet covering sixteen pages, so that 
the cost is about $.095 a page. If the 
cost of the first run is $1.50 per page 
for 100 prints, and sheets are saved, cost 
of second run, including charge for storage, is $.80 per page for 150 prints, a
difference of 42%. 

*Chicago Planograph Corporation, 517 South 
Jefferson Street, Chicago*. Retains all 
negatives, and, if customer desires, plates 
as well. "Certain percentage" of reduction given on reruns. 

*The Copifyer Corporation of Ohio, 1111 Power 
Avenue, Cleveland*. Keeps plates and negatives until the customer releases them. No {% include pagebreak.html canvas=68 %} charge is made for negatives, but a charge 
of $1.00 per plate is made after three 
months. 

*The Tudor Press, Inc., 251 Causeway Street, 
Boston*. Holds plates and negatives for 
one year, and after one year, if ordered. 
Reprints made at approximately $.50 per 
page less. If cost of first runs as 
$125.00 (exclusive of binding and paper 
costs) and sheets are saved, cost of second run is $61.00, a difference of 51½%.

*William B. Burford Printing Company, 
58 South Meridian Street, Indianapolis*. 
Saves both plates and negatives for six 
months without storage charge, allowing 
50% reduction for reprints. 

*R. R. Donnelley and Sons Company, 350 East 
22 Street, Chicago*. Saves negatives without charge indefinitely. Plates can be 
saved on request for a short period for 
reruns. If plates cannot be used after 
this period, a charge is made for making 
new ones. 

The importance of reprint economy 
is twofold. It can lower the cost of certain specific printings of books, and it 
can affect policy in regard to overprints. 
If a second printing is cheaply available, 
it is not necessary to risk large first 
printings that may remain unsold. 

## Photo-Offset: the Outlook for the Future 

The development of the photo-offset 
apparatus as an additional shop equipment for {% include columnbreak.html canvas=68 col=2 %} letterpress printers has already had an important influence on scholarship through 
the production of cheap reprints. In at 
least one instance---the making of the new 
Early Modern English and Middle English Dictionaries under the sponsorship of the American Council of Learned Societies---it has 
resulted in an extraordinary saving of 
scholarly labor. The editors of these new 
dictionaries have selected the writings of 
this period to be used in the dictionaries. 
The manuscripts and early prints have been 
reproduced by photo-offset and set before 
the scholars in loose-leaf form---about 200 
impressions of each page. The scholar 
takes one page and marks in it all the 
words to be indexed. A typist then takes 
one loose-leaf for each word marked by the 
scholar, types the marked work at the top 
of the leaf and files it alphabetically. 
This method would seem to reduce the making 
of concordances to an almost wholly mechanical procedure. 

What kinds of technological developments of photolithography would be 
likely to have an important impact on 
scholarship? Nothing that affects the 
cost levels of the very long runs will have 
any significance.[^n13] But if the time should 
come when the apparatus would be so far 
simplified and the process so far cheapened 
that it could become a kind of multiple 
photostat, a part of the equipment of any 
large library and serviced by ordinary library labor, turning out extra copies of 
library rarities for sale or exchange with 
other libraries and sometimes multiplying 
overused library materials for teaching 
purposes, great results in the intellectual 

[^n13]: Technological developments having their principal bearing on long-run work are the *Uhertype* apparatus, 
    consisting of a photo-composing machine, by which letters are photographed on a film strip, and a 
    make-up machine, which is a large reproducing camera; *The Typesetter*, which operates slug-casting 
    machines automatically with perforated tape; the *Typary*, producing proof slips, photoprinted on paper, 
    which may be used to make negatives from which positives are produced on offset metal plates; sometimes translucent paper is used in the machine to make proofs which can be used directly on the metal 
    plates; the *Typon*, employed for photo-production with the *Typary* by camera or contact, in which a paper strip film is used instead of a dry or wet plate; *Walton's typesetting machine*, which writes directly on a metal sheet for offset printing; various other *devices activated by the photoelectric cell*. In offset printing, important experiments are being made in *mercury processes*, in which mercury is used instead of water as an ink-repelling medium; in developing formulae for producing *deep-etched plates*; in 
    *dry offset*, when the plate is treated with an ink repellent, which does away with 
    the moistening rollers of the offset press and controls both the temperature of the plate and the humidity of the air around the plate, thus providing and keeping constant the moisture needed through-out the run.

{% include pagebreak.html canvas=71 %}  

world would be likely to follow. How far 
is technology from that possibility? Certain new developments tending in this direction have come to the knowledge of the 
writer, but must for the time being be 
kept confidential. 

The rotaprint was the first machine to offer itself as a piece of office 
equipment. The cost of a rotaprint installation is about $1000 (9″ x 14″ model, 
friction feed; suction feed, about $1575). 
The latest rotaprint model, R 50, is 
$660.00 complete. Compare this with the 
price of photostat equipment, which is 
$800. Then came the multilith, offering 
an installation for $630.00 (friction feed, 
in its standard size, 9½″ x 12½″ 
printing surface, 10″ x 14″ paper). There 
has been developed a combination mimeograph and offset press which will permit a 
changing over from the mimeograph stencil, 
inked from the inside, to a photo-offset 
metal plate, inked from the outside. There 
is some possibility that a system may be 
devised whereby a kind of photostat paper 
can be treated to become a printing surface. The operator would make a photostat 
copy of a page, treat the photostat negative, fasten it on a small press, and run 
off a number of copies. New developments 
are appearing every year. The major institutional changes in scholarship can be expected to begin with the development of a 
photo-offset process so simple that the 
printing surface is prepared at the area 
cost level of the photostat copy and the 
running costs of making copies stand at the 
cost level of the mimeograph,. 

## Reprint Processes: Dermaprint 

The dermaprint is at present the 
process that tends toward this desideratum. 
It is a photographic process tied to the 
mimeograph. It is not planographic nor 
does it use the offset principle, but it 
does the same kind of work that the cheaper 
offset presses do. The relative fineness 
of the products of these processes can be 
compared if the sample dermaprint page 
bound herewith (Figure XIV) is compared 
with the sample products of the multilith 
and rotaprint (Figures XXV and XXVI). 

The page to be dermaprinted was 
selected because it was yellowed with age 
and contained a line cut. The standard 
charge of the A. B. Dick Company for an {% include columnbreak.html canvas=71 col=2 %} 8½″ x 11″ dermaprint stencil is $3.50, 
which includes a small amount of retouching. If a considerable amount of retouching is necessary, there is a standard extra charge of $1.00 per hour. The cost of 
the materials needed to make this particular stencil was $.64, which included a 
film negative and a film positive. Had a 
paper negative and a paper positive been 
used, the materials cost would have been 
somewhat lower. One hour and forty-five 
minutes were needed for the preparation of 
the stencil. 

While the A. B. Dick Company gave 
their very generous cooperation in the 
preparation of the dermaprint stencil reproduced here, they call attention to the 
fact that, in general, the dermaprint process at the present time is more to be used 
with direct contact prints than with the 
use of the camera. The reader may judge 
for himself, by comparing the dermaprint 
product shown here with the cost calculations given above, what place dermaprinting 
can have in the reproduction of research 
materials. 

The dermaprint stencil resembles 
the ordinary mimeograph stencil in appearance. It is a fibrous sheet impregnated 
with a substance impervious to ink. But 
whereas the ordinary mimeograph stencil is 
impregnated with a material resembling wax, 
which can be mechanically abraded by the 
typewriter stroke until the ink will penetrate through the bruised parts, the dermaprint stencil is impregnated with some kind 
of gelatinlike substance which is subject 
to tanning or toughening in the presence 
of the chromate ion. Whereas ordinary gelatin will dissolve in water, a gelatin that 
has been tanned will resist water. This 
is the chemical principle upon which the 
dermaprint works. 

The raw sheet, already covered with 
a gelatin, is sensitized with ammonium bichromate or, more commonly, potassium bichromate. Ultra-violet light on the potassium bichromate will release the chromate 
ions and tan the gelatin. It is only necessary, then, to subject to ultra-violet 
light those parts of the sheet that are to 
be kept ink-resistant. The dermaprint 
stencil must, therefore, be prepared by 
using a black-on-white or positive photograph, or, as in the production of the so-called "special stencil," from an original {% include pagebreak.html canvas=72 %} black-on-white drawing on very thin or 
transparent paper, tracing cloth, vellum, 
or celluloid. In this it differs from the 
ordinary photo-offset metal sheet, which is 
prepared as a printing surface by using a 
negative photograph. The light that reaches the surface of the offset metal sheet 
hardens upon the metal the substance that 
will accept ink; the light that reaches the 
surface of the dermaprint stencil hardens 
the substance that will resist ink and keep 
it from passing through. The positive 
photograph or the original drawing is 
pressed against the dermaprint sheet in a 
vacuum frame and exposed to an intense 
light. Then it is given a bath in warm 
water and dried. The warm water dissolves 
out that part of the gelatin which has 
been protected by black ink from the rays 
of the light, but leaves the other part intact. Thus a stencil has been prepared 
automatically. 

 {% include columnbreak.html canvas=72 col=2 %} The cost of equipment for the dermaprint comes into the same price range with 
the cost of multilith apparatus unless the 
photostat and the mimeograph have already 
been purchased.[^n14] 

| Estimated Cost of dermaprint equipment if mimeograph and photostat are available ... | $23.00 -- $350.00 |
| Estimated cost of dermaprint equipment, including photographic and mimeograph apparatus ... | $1275.00 |

The cost of printing surface for 
the dermaprint process as compared with 
rotaprint and multilith metal sheets is 
shown in Table VII below. 

The supplementary photographic supplies needed for the dermaprint should normally cost more than those for photo-offset, 
except in the case of the direct method,

[^n14]: The photographic equipment needed for transferring matter to the stencil may cost from $20.00 to 
    $1300, with many possible combinations in between. 
    The $20.00 equipment, which may be used for the 
    direct process only, does not include a vacuum frame; the same equipment, with a $60.00 Eastman pressure frame, costs $75.00, and with a vacuum frame, $150.00. This same equipment may be used to prepare the photographic stencils if the user purchases his film positives from a maker of offset plates. 
    If a photostat and a special adapting holder are used, the equipment will cost about $260.00, figuring $85.00 for a holder, $155.00 for a vacuum frame, and about $20.00 for dark-room equipment; if the 
    photostat prepares a film positive, the $23.00 equipment may be used, the total cost of the equipment 
    being about $110.00. Mimeographs vary in price from $30.00 to $450.00. 
  
 {% include pagebreak.html canvas=73 %} 

because the dermaprint must have a positive 
copy, while photo-offset can use the negative. The photographer is through when he 
has made his negative for photo-offset, but 
if he is preparing for the dermaprint, he 
is only half through and must still make a 
positive from his negative.[^15] The cost of 
making this positive copy can be kept down 
if it is made by the filmslide process (see 
Chapter VI). Ordinarily the dermaprint 
uses just twice as much photographic paper 
as photo-offset. Moreover, it is not quite 
certain that the dermaprint can be prepared with a paper negative; if it turns 
out that film negatives are required, the 
cost of photographic materials mounts even 
further above the level of the photographic requirements of photo-offset. 

 {% include columnbreak.html canvas=73 col=2 %} Whether the dermaprint allows genuine operating economies is still an open 
question. The A. B. Dick Company offers to 
prepare these stencils, but the prices are 
so high that the service has no place in 
competition with other methods of book production. 

Customer installations make these 
prices less important. The A. B. Dick 
Company has decided definitely to sell the 
unsensitized stencils at $7.00 a package 
or $.145 each, in the legal size, as indicated in a recent letter to the Joint Committee. Dermaprinting, therefore, would 
seem to be a practical reproduction method 
for any institution possessing photographic 
equipment and a mimeograph.[^16]

[^15]: A letter recently received indicates that a method has been devised whereby, without any further 
    photographic process, the negative can be reversed into a positive.
 
[^16]: Another interesting device that has been used to some extent in Europe but has no practical importance 
    in America is the Opalograph. The Opalograph principle bears a faint resemblance to that of the mimeograph. A slab of porcelain-like composition receptive to ink has painted upon it a film that will 
    resist ink. This film can be cut by ammonia fumes. An ink which gives forth ammonia fumes is used 
    in preparing the master copy. The master copy is imposed on the porcelain slab, thus cutting the text 
    in the film and reaching through to the porcelain slab. The slab is then inked and used for a printing surface on a press not unlike a small flat—bed cylinder press. There is a kind of special photographic film which can be prepared as a positive copy, impregnated with an ammonium substance and 
    used to cut through to the ink-receptive stone. Thus the Opalograph might be used for the reproduction of photographed texts, but the costs are high, and the process has no place in America. 
    
    A process used in Germany to bring out-of-print books into print is the Manul or Beha process. This is a planographic process differing from the usual method only in the way in which negatives are made, before the image is burnt into the sensitized metal sheet. But in making these negatives, it is necessary to destroy two copies of the original book from which they are made, The process is one of the "direct copying" processes; that is to say, it dispenses with the use of the camera. 
    Glass is covered with a light-sensitive emulsion. The page to be copied is laid on this glass, and 
    light is reflected from beneath. Under the white parts of the paper, which reflect the light, the solution is rendered insoluble; under the dark parts it continues soluble. The substances used are 
    probably a gelatin and a chromate, as in the dermaprint. The whole glass is covered with an organic 
    coloring matter. The soluble parts are washed away, leaving the negative copy of the original as a 
    kind of stencil upon the glass. This stencil is backed with thin paper, dried a 
    little and peeled off.  It is then a negative ready to be transferred to the metal sheet. The Manul 
    process of the Ullman Company and the Beha process of Breitkopf and Hartel seem to be the same thing. 
    The German firms offering to reproduce by this process indicate by their quotations that the saving is 
    greater than is possible with straight photo-offset printing. 

 {% include pagebreak.html canvas=74 %} The following table is a summary comparison of the factors affecting book {% include columnbreak.html canvas=74 col=2 %} manufacturing costs by three processes---printing, mimeoform, and photo-offset. 

TABLE IX 

| | PRINTING | MIMEOFORM | PHOTO-OFFSET |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| First Costs (composition) | Varies directly with number of words or ems, and only slightly affected by type face, leading, etc. Time and a half and double time are charged for footnotes, tabular matter, etc. |  Varies directly with number of words or ems, and only slightly affected by type size, type face. Composition about 30% less compact than for ordinary printing. Cost reckoned on a page basis. All type sizes on a 12-point body. | No composition costs for reprinting. (The behavior of typescript composition costs will be analyzed in the next chapter. |
| First Costs (area) | Make-up varies directly with number of forms and complexity of work) (e.g., footnotes, illlustrations, tabular matter, etc.). Make-ready varies in the same way as make-up. Neither is affected by size of edition. | No make-up since type is automatically transferred to multigraph drum by monotype caster. No make-ready. | The step the equivalent of make-up in printing is the preparation of plates. The cost equals that of make-up and make-ready in printing of small editions. Practically no make-ready. |
| Running Costs | Varies directly with size of edition, number om forms, grade of paper, and type of binding. | Variations similar to those in printing. Since pages are printed separately, the binding costs rise above those of printed 16-page signatures. | Variations similar to those in printing. Binding costs rise slightly for small press. |
| Reprint Costs | Electrotype takes $1.50 a page. This cost makes new composition costs unnecessary. By storing type or making stereotypes and electrotypes, new composition costs are unnecessary. | None | Storage of metal sheets at $.00 to $.10 per page reduces cost by approximately 50%; storage of negative by about 15%. |
