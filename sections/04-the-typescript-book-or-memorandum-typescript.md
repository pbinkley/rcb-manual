 {% include pagebreak.html canvas=75 %} The typewriter has been well established as the device by which all scholarly 
work is prepared for publication. Authors 
often use it when drafting their manuscripts. Typed copy is always submitted to 
the publisher by the author and to the linotyper by the publishers. The fact that 
the typewriting stage intervenes so many 
times in the preparation of reading matter 
for distribution raises a question as to 
whether typescript could be carried not 
only as far as the linotyper, but also as 
far as the reader. In other words, what is 
the case for the typescript book? 

In terms of the number of words 
written or the number of words printed and 
read, typescript rivals newsprint as the 
standard conventional writing form of contemporary civilization. Everyone is familiar with the typescript letter. Business 
men use information sheets and confidential 
letter services that are really periodicals 
in mimeographed form; they are becoming increasingly accustomed to seeing catalogues 
and statistical studies produced in typescript by "near-print" methods. The Government frequently mimeographs its reports. 
But the use of typescript is not generally 
associated with the publication of the internal documentation of scholarship. This 
is true, not on account of any deficiency 
from the standpoint of legibility, but because the possibilities of reproducing 
typescript economically and attractively 
have not been fully explored by the scholarly world. 

This is really surprising in view 
of the fact that nearly everyone knows in a 
general way the qualities of the typewriter and the extent to which it has affected 
office practice. The typewriter itself is 
so cheap and widely distributed, and the 
skill to use it is so easily acquired, that 
its operating costs are low. Bond paper, 
filing cabinets, folders, and loose-leaf 
notebooks have been standardized to sizes {% include columnbreak.html canvas=75 col=2 %} 
that conform to it. Office appliances, even 
the office offset press, are keyed to its 
8½″ x 11″ sheet. There is only one 
standard measurement that has never conformed to it---that is library shelving. Library shelving is spaced to care for pages 
10″ or less in height. Libraries receiving typescript books on full-size typewriter paper are put to the inconvenience of 
shelving them with oversize books. But 
elsewhere the typewriter has brought equipment and practice into line with its dimensions. 

By what means may the typescript 
book be produced? It may be a first copy 
from under the typewriter ribbon, as so 
many of our theses are, or it may be a copy 
multiplied by hectograph, mimeograph, or 
photo-offset. The choice of any of these 
reproduction methods for the multiplying of 
typescript material depends upon the degree of legibility afforded by the technique selected and upon the costs involved, 
which may be analyzed, as in the case of 
the printed books, as first costs (composition and area costs) and running costs. Of 
the methods mentioned, photo-offset presents the most complex problems in cost 
levels and legibility on account of the 
possibility of photographically reducing 
the size of the typescript in making a 
photo-offset copy. 

The four mechanical devices for 
multiplying typescript will be separately 
analyzed in the following chapter, but it 
is necessary in the first instance to 
understand the characteristics of the typewriter itself. 

## The Standard Typewriter 

The standard typewriters are priced 
at about $110.00. The type is standardized 
in two sizes, known as pica and elite. The 
pica typewriter lays down ten letters to 
the inch, the elite, twelve. How do these 
typescript letters compare with the letters {% include pagebreak.html canvas=76 %} **[note: this page is set in different typefaces to illustrate spacing]**
of relief printing? A peculiarity of typescript as compared with print-face is the 
equal width of the letters. The typescript 
"i" is just as broad as the "m". This 
equal width is a necessary consequence of 
the mechanical system by which the type- 
writer spaces letters. A number of design- 
ers have proposed or attempted a typescript 
face that will resemble print-face; the 
task of making such a typescript face is 
rendered difficult simply because of the 
equal spacing of the typewriter mechanism. 
A change of the spacing system that would 
give the "i" a narrow space and the "m" a 
broad one would greatly complicate the machine and make it more expensive. 

A new spacing mechanism has 
recently appeared in Germany. One model 
is available in America, in the hands of 
Edwards Brothers. This paragraph has 
been typed with it. Note that there are three 
different letter widths---the narrow letters 
such as f and i, the middle-sized letters 
such as d and g, and the two broad letters, 
w and m. The typewriter letter levers are 
linked each with one of two spacing rods; 
the m and w are given additional width by 
the typist, who strikes the space bar when- 
ever she uses these two letters. 

The difference in spacing is easily seen when set in a column in groups of 
six.

| fff | fff |

| www | www |

This new spacing device opens 
a new field for the designers of typescript 
face. 

Special types are available, such 
as micro-elite, laying down fourteen letters to the inch, or ultra micro-elite, laying down sixteen letters to the inch. Their 
interlinear spacing is usually six lines to 
the inch. A sample page done with micro-{%- include columnbreak.html canvas=76 col=2 -%}elite type is shown in Figure XXVIII. 

## The Equivalence of Type and Typescript 

If the horizontal measurement of 
typescript were taken as the basis in assigning it a position in the point system 
of typography, the following table of 
equivalents would result: 

Pica typescript would be equivalent to 14-pt. type.   
Elite typescript would be equivalent to 12-pt. type.   
Pica reduced to 80% of normal size to 10-pt. type.   
Pica reduced to 70% of normal size to 9-pt. type.   
Pica reduced to 60% of normal size to 8-pt. type.   
Pica reduced to 50% of normal size to 7-pt. type.   
Pica reduced to 40% of normal size to 6-pt. type.   
Pica reduced to 30% of normal size to 5-pt. type.   

If, on the other hand, the vertical measurement of typescript were 
taken, it would be obvious that

Pica typescript would be equivalent to 10-pt. type.   
Elite typescript would be equivalent to 8-pt. type.   
Pica reduced to 80% of normal size to 7-pt. type.   
Pica reduced to 70% of normal size to 6-pt. type.   

The relative importance of the horizontal and vertical measurements of type 
controlling legibility has not been determined; it is, therefore, difficult to 
work out an accurate table of equivalents 
between print-face and typescript sizes and 
reductions. Since groups of letters or 
words, instead of single letters, constitute a sensory unit, it is probable that 
the vertical measurement of type is a more 
important factor in its effect on the reading rate, and consequently upon legibility, 
than the horizontal measurement. If such 
is the case, it would follow that typescript, despite its horizontal spread, is 
but slightly more legible than print-face 
of the same vertical point size. Figure XV shows blocks of 11-, 9-, 7-, and 6-point print-face type and corresponding 
blocks of typescript reduced to approximately the same legibility. The reader may 
note how far legibility affects word content by comparing the samples. To judge 
how far legibility suffers when typescript 
is so reduced as to lay down the same word 
content as print-face type on an identical 
area, the reader is asked to examine Figure XXIX.

THE MOST REVOLUTIONARY INVENTION
SINCE the ADVENT of PHOTOLITHOGRAPHY

Simple Paper Permits Alignment of Typewriting 

Scholars have been slow to accept photolithography as a solution of the problem of 
scholarly publishing because of the unconventional format which is produced by typescript.
Because of the equal spacing produced by the 
conventional typewriter, a compromise had to 
be made in the design of the letters so that 
wide and narrow letters would occupy the same 
space. The result was that a letter such as 
'm' had to be condensed, and a narrow letter 
such as 'i' had to be extended. 

The fallacy of attempting to put regular 
printing types on the ordinary equal space 
typewriter is illustrated in the following 
paragraphs. The copy in the first paragraph 
was set up by a printer in the usual manner, 
without any attempt at justification. It was 
then reset, as it would appear if the type 
used were attached to the conventional typewriter. The lower case 'w' was used as the 
standard of horizontal spacing.

The typewriter, moreover, does not produce 
justified lines, leaving an uneven right-hand 
margin so unusual in book printing that conventional taste will prevent the ready acceptance of typescript books. Fortunately it is 
now possible by the use of Vogeltype Aligning 
Paper to overcome one of the greatest objections to the use of typescript in scholarly 
work. The invention also permits the production of many sizes and styles of type without 
any change in the typewriter keyboard, as 
illustrated in the headlines on this page. 

By producing a justified right-hand margin, 
typescript approaches printface in appearance. 
Doubtless through the development of a typewriter having automatic variable spacing, 
 {% include columnbreak.html canvas=79 col=2 %} 
such as was built into the first typewriters 
invented, and type similar to ordinary printface, it will be possible for a scholar at 
his desk to produce a page format which can 
not be distinguished from real typeset matter. 
Thus modern technology, curiously, will bring 
man back to the conditions of the Middle Ages, 
when the scholar often was his own scribe. 

{% include osd_iiif_image_viewer.html xywh="1314, 1171, 1232, 1300" canvas="79" %}

A new stretchable paper permits typewritten 
copy to be aligned evenly on right-hand edges, 
allows lithographic production of books, briefs, 
etc., closely resembling printing, but cheaper 

Scholars, moreover, Will be able to illustrate their texts with photographs, graphs 
and tabular matter simply by making a pasteup 
combining illustrations and text. The photolithographic process allows great flexibility 
in preparing copy. Thus the above photograph 
of Vogeltype Aligning Paper was reproduced on 
a plate for the offset press by simply pasting a clipping from a magazine into its position in the text. 

The greatly reduced reproductions on the 
reverse side of this page illustrate some of 
the many applications of Vogeltype Aligning 
Paper. Books, bulletins, house organs, proceedings of meetings, circulars, theses and 
lectures are now produced without the expense 
of type composition and engravings.

FIGURE XVII 

MASTER COPY FOR PHOTO OFFSET PRINTING


Business men throughout the country, particularly 
those known as printers, are well aware of the fact 
that a new printing process is here, and that very 
large savings are possible from its use. This new 
method is known as *Offset Lithography*. It is a simple process, fast and inexpensive. Illustrations 
can be used at no extra cost for plates. Business 
offices are finding it desirable to install offset 
presses, and many hundreds of these machines are turning out work that is satisfactory in every way. Speed 
and economy are the factors that create interest. 
Where the cost of the offset press is too much for 
the smaller business offices, it is the practice for 
such offices to make their own master copy and send 
same to a commercial offset house to be printed. 

The great problem in Photo Offset work is met in the 
making of the *master copy*. The copy may be printed 
from type set up by a printer, composed on a linotype, written by a typewriter, or by the *Vari-typer 
Composing Machine*, built especially for this work. 
Type-set or linotype copy is too expensive, for after the matter is set up, the greatest part of the 
printing cost has then been incurred. Typewriting 
is very unsatisfactory, because only one style of 
type can be used on any one machine. Typewritten 
matter is cold and anemic to the artistic eye, and 
creates the very effect most business men are trying 
to escape. The only real composing machine which 
will write copy at a low cost, and at the same time 
absolutely delight the person interested, is the 
*Vari-typer*, manufactured in New York City by the 
Ralph C. Coxhead Corporation. It must be stated here, 
however, that as with most machines, the degree of 
satisfaction will vary with the intelligence and artistry of the operator. 

The *Vari-typer* is constructed to use different type 
plates, of which more than sixty in English are available, and more than two-hundred in foreign languages. 
Type may be changed instantly. *Variable character 
spacing* is a feature of each machine, which means that 
letters may be written at as many characters to the 
inch as the different sizes of type make necessary, 
limited, of course, to 3 different spacings on any 
one machine. These three may be any combination of 
the spacings 10, 12, 14 or 16 letters to the inch. 
This machine also permits the use of six *different 
vertical or line spacings*. The keyboard is easy to 
operate especially if the operator has had typewriter 
experience as the touch system is used for both and 
the keyboards are almost exactly alike. 

Provision is made for **LARGE BOLD HEADINGS** *and this 
effect is very cleverly produced. Justification of 
the right hand margin* requires first writing of the 
copy so as to determine what adjustment is necessary 
and to so indicate at the end of each line. This 
adjustment is provided for by absorption or extension in the second writing by use of a device called 
the *half-back spacer*. This method prevents the rivers of white space so common to justification when 
attempted by typewriters and which is so objectionable to good printers. 
 {% include columnbreak.html canvas=82 col=2 %} 

*Vari-typer* is manufactured in many models to meet 
different requirements. The special machine which 
the Coxhead Corporation builds for the *Photo Offset* 
Field, is equipped with special mechanism to handle 
carbon paper ribbon in addition to cotton and silk 
ribbons. The *carbon paper ribbons* produce remarkably 
clean cut work and a specially constructed ribbon, 
300 feet in length, is used which is different than 
any other ribbon on the market. This ribbon does 
not travel when the space bar is used, thus producing a considerable economy. 

Recently this Company produced a new type plate with 
all metal construction which is a great improvement 
over anything so far offered to the trade. It is 
called *Krometal* and produces copy that should please 
those who like artistic results. Most of the plates 
used on the *Vari-typer Composing Machines* are being 
built under the new *Krometal* process. 

Writers of manuscript find many features that *Vari-typer* provides, of unusual value. The advantages 
that follow the ability to use *italics* in marking 
passages for emphasis is an example. As the machine 
is always loaded with two type plates, the operator 
may change instantly from one to the other by a simple movement of the wrist. The *variation of type* is 
of tremendous interest to all writers. 

Statisticians, librarians, accountants are very enthusiastic over the condensation possibilities of 
the *Vari-typer* through the use of proper typography. 
Large statements may be reduced as much as 50% without detracting from the readability. One large concern in Cleveland, Ohio, we are told, uses nine *Vari-typers* on the writing of statements in *condensed 
form*. The results are very pleasing to executives. 

Footnotes are outstanding in their effect when written with the type appropriate for this purpose. 

The Coxhead Company is continually working on new 
styles of type and are always interested in discussing this subject with the business and professional 
man. 

Considering the work that this composing machine 
does, the cost is very reasonable. It is well known 
that composition forms the greater part of printing 
prices and it does seem that the *Vari-typer* can soon 
save its cost to any business man interested in the 
subject. The fact that this machine is sold in almost every country of the world, is indication that 
it solves one problem of the office executive, that 
of doing necessary work at a saving in cost and with 
the desired effect. 

Much thought should be given to the matter of composition for photo offset presses, as the saving to 
be made from the use of this process will soon disappear, if either the results are unsatisfactory, or 
the method used for composition proves too costly. 
It should not be forgotten that some reduction of 
copy through the camera will enhance the result. 

 {% include pagebreak.html canvas=83 %} 

## The Uneven Right-Hand Margin 

Closely related to the fact that 
typescript letters are of equal width is 
the inability of the machine to make an 
even right-hand margin. The linotype or 
monotype readjusts the spacing of the letters in a line in such a way as to make all 
of the lines on a page equal in length or, 
as it is said, to "justify" them. The typewriter cannot do this, except by one or two 
expensive means, which require either a 
special typewriter and an extra typing, or 
a special kind of paper. 

By using the Varityper, and by resorting to two typings, an even right-hand 
margin can be made. On the first copy the 
typist makes the right-hand margin come as 
near the line as possible, usually missing 
it by not more than two or three letters 
long or short. Then the copy is blue- 
penciled to indicate places where the 
space can be extended or contracted. In a 
second typing, each line will be written 
exactly as it is in the first copy, except 
that the extra letters will be absorbed in 
the line by crowding the spacing between 
the words or letters, or a short line will 
be stretched out by increasing the spaces 
between the words or letters. Opinions 
differ as to whether the resulting copy 
looks choppy or uneven. A sample of Varitype work is shown in Figure XVII. As has 
been said, this process requires the use of 
the Varityper machine, which has a variable 
horizontal spacing, and of course the extra typing process adds to the composition 
cost for labor and proofreading. This method of justifying the right-hand margin 
could be used for hectographing and mimeographing as well as for photo-offset work. 

There is another method which can 
be used for justifying the right-hand margin. The Vogeltype Aligning Paper Corporation, Federal Trust Building, Newark, New 
Jersey, has devised a special kind of 
stretchable paper cemented to a backing 
sheet. The copy is typed on this paper in 
the conventional manner without regard to 
alignment. After the sheet is taken from 
the typewriter, short lines are stretched 
to the correct length, as illustrated in 
Figure XVI. At present the paper is 
priced at $.24 a sheet in quantities of 
twenty-five sheets, with reductions in price 
for larger quantities. The sheets are made 
to contain from forty-eight to eighty lines 
 {% include columnbreak.html canvas=83 col=2 %} 
of type each, and each line has a maximum 
length of 9″. Separate sheets are made for 
vertical line spacing of three, four, four 
and one-half, five, and six lines to the 
inch. For great primer type (eighteen 
point), four lines to the inch give the 
most readable results; pica and elite type 
give the best results with five and six- 
space paper respectively. From a typographic standpoint, copy set with these 
spaces between the lines is more readable 
than when lines are set closer to each 
other. The typing area of the sheets 
ranges from 9″ x 10″ to 9″ x 16″.

A third device for justifying typescript is a mechanism in the process of development by Professor Charles C. Peters of 
the Pennsylvania State College. An attachment to an ordinary typewriter automatically controls the length of the line. This 
attachment consists essentially of a screw 
which progressively displaces the carriage 
in relation to the writing point. The justifying requires a preliminary or fair copy 
typing to indicate the number of spaces by 
which the line must be lengthened or shortened. In the format typing, the proper one 
of seven controls is engaged at the beginning of each line, and the excess of deficiency in length is apportioned equally 
among the fifty-four or so spaces. The apparatus at present writing permits lengthening or shortening by a maximum of three 
spaces. Pending the patenting of the device and its assignment to a commercial 
company, Dr. Peters will furnish a simple 
form of this device for use with any make 
of typewriter for $12.00, or a more automatic form for $25.00. Changes necessary 
in the typewriter itself restrict the line 
which may subsequently be written with it 
to about seven inches in the case of the 
10″-typewriter. An alternative is to purchase through Dr. Peters a typewriter with 
the adjustment already made, for $60.00 or 
$75.00, depending upon the type of attachment furnished. The reader is referred to 
Statistical Procedures and Their Mathematical Bases, by Dr. Peters and Walter P. Van-Voohis (1935) as an example of a photo-offset book for which the master copy was 
prepared by Dr. Peters' device. 

## The Varityper and the Electromatic Typewriter 

There are two special typewriters {% include pagebreak.html canvas=84 %} which are at once more expensive and more 
useful for certain typing processes. The 
Varityper, mentioned above, was developed 
from the Hammond machine; it permits the 
typist to choose among a number of type 
faces, type sizes, and corresponding vertical and horizontal spacings. These alternatives are here tabulated and some of the 
faces available are shown in Figure XVIII. 

{% include table.html tab="10" %}

Eighteen characters to the inch may 
be had on the "T", "L", and "W" in place of 
the sixteen characters to the inch, and on 
the "Q" in place of the fourteen, at an additional charge of $25.00 per machine. The 
fourteen-to-the-inch spacing and the sixteen-to-the-inch spacing are the same as 
those called "micro-elite" and "ultra- 
micro-elite" on the standard typewriters. 

All type plates are priced at $5.00. 
each. The Varityper is sold for $210.00 to 
$360.00 for the power-run models, ranging 
from a 9″- to a 24″-carriage, and for 
$140.00 to $160.00 for the non-motor models, which can be obtained with a 9″-carriage only. 

The Electromatic typewriter has the 
standard typescript faces and spacings, but 
makes the impression with electric power 
rather than finger power. It is especially useful in increasing the number of legible carbon copies, where pressure in the 
typewriter strokes is all-important. The 
Standard Electromatic typewriter is sold 
for $225.00 for the 12″-carriage and 
$250.00 for the 16″-carriage.

## Typing Stages in Book Production: Draft, Fair, and Format Copies 

Typing costs exhibit an interesting flexibility: 
they vary with the number 
of times a given text is retyped in the 
course of its preparation. In the normal 
production of a book the text is likely to 
be several times copied and corrected. Are 
the costs of all these typing operations to 
be lumped as composition costs? 

The accurate study of the typewriting costs to be assessed against the *multiplication* of the book requires that they 
be separated from those incidental to the 
*writing* of the book. For purposes of clarity, therefore, three stages in the typescript preparation of a book may be distinguished from each other. 

The first stage is the making of 
the *draft copy*. This is the author's product. It may be in longhand or in typescript, or in a combination of both. It is 
the pile of pages, often much interlined 
and scratched, which the writer turns over 
to a typist, if he can afford one. 

The second stage in the preparation of the book is here called the making 
of the *fair copy*. The fair copy is the 
manuscript as it has been prepared for submission to an editor if the book is to be 
printed; it is the pile of typescript that 
comes back from the typist. Sometimes the 
author prepares his own fair copy; sometimes the so-called fair copy is not very 
fair. But as a normal stage in the normal 

{% include pagebreak.html canvas=85 insert=true %} 

{% include figure.html fig="18" %}

{% include pagebreak.html canvas=86 insert=true %} 

 {% include pagebreak.html canvas=87 %} 

movement of a book, this fair copy typing 
can be set apart from the making of the 
draft copy. It is a more mechanical procedure; a typist can make the fair copy, 
only the author can make the draft copy. 

If the book is to be multiplied in 
typescript, a third stage will intervene, 
and a third typing may be necessary. The 
text must be transferred to the printing 
surface medium required by the chosen reproduction process. Also the usual one-column, double-spaced format used for the 
fair-copying operation may not be the 
most desirable format for the finished 
typescript book; the margins of the fair 
copy may be too narrow for maximum legibility in hectographing; the one-column format of the fair copy may be less desirable 
than a two-column one if mimeographing is 
decided upon; the typed letters of the 
fair copy may not be dark enough or clean-cut enough to photograph well for photo-offset reproduction. The final typing required to put the text in the desired 
format on the hectograph master sheet, the 
mimeograph stencil, or the master copy paper for photo-offset is called the *format 
typing*. 

To summarize: the draft copy is a 
step in the writing of a books; the cost of 
making it is not a composition cost in the 
case of either the printed book or the 
typescript book. The cost of the format 
typing, which is always a stage in the multiplication of the typescript book, is always a true composition cost. The fair 
copy may be copy for the linotyper or 
photo-offset typist, in which case its 
cost is not a true composition cost, as its 
making is a stage in the writing process. 
If it is merged with the format typing in 
any of the typescript bookmaking processes, 
it is a step in the multiplication of the 
book, and its cost is a true composition 
cost. 

## The Fair Copy as a Stage in the Writing Process
 
The author of a book is usually ex{%- include columnbreak.html canvas=87 col=2 -%}pected to bring his work through the fair 
copy stage at his own expense. The cost 
of preparing the fair copy depends in part 
upon the condition of the draft copy. There 
may be a variation of 20% to 33⅓% in the 
typing charges due to the condition of the 
draft. The cost depends also upon the number of unusual symbols and figures that occur, as it takes longer to type technical 
and tabular material than straight non-technical text. But fundamentally the cost 
of preparing a fair copy from a draft is
determined by the length of the manuscript. 

The unit of measurement for typewriter work ought to be the keystroke, but 
it is usually the page of 250 to 300 words, 
double-spaced. The keystroke corresponds 
roughly to the *em* of linotype composition. 
Whereas the number of ems per word is usually only four or five, the number of keystrokes varies from six to seven. 

It is estimated that in copying 
typescript, a standard speed ought to be 
5,500 to 11,700 keystrokes per hour, 
equivalent to 915 to 1950 words.[^n1] This

gathering estimates of standard speeds and 
figures for wage levels, consulting advertisements in writers manuals, and collecting specific commercial estimates from typing bureaus, a rough estimate has been 
made of the cost of typescript copying, per 
thousand words:

A consideration of these costs 
gives rise to the question of whether or 
not it would be profitable to turn over a 
draft copy in fairly good condition to a 
publisher without having a fair copy made. 
It must be taken for granted that printing 
requires a carefully prepared fair copy. 
If an imperfect copy is set before the linotyper, the author's correction charges 
mount rapidly. As a matter of fact, the 
author often sends to the editor a supposedly fair copy which still contains innumerable crudities and easily corrected 
errors. The editors of publishing houses 
have learned to expect this. They maintain in their offices readers who can go 
over the author's supposedly fair copy and 
make it ready for the linotyper. This 
service is necessarily assessed into the 
cost of printed books as an editorial cost. 
It will be seen that the typescript book 
may be produced without incurring this 
 {% include columnbreak.html canvas=88 col=2 %} 
cost---and also without the perfection that 
results from this editorial work. If an 
author is subsidizing the publication of 
his book, he pays for the production of a 
perfect fair copy whether his payments go 
to a typists or to his publisher or both; if 
the book is published commercially, the 
charge for some stages in the making of a 
fair copy may be avoided by the author. 

## The Fair Copy as a Stage in the Multiplication of a Book: the Merging of the Fair and Format Copies 

The making of the fair copy is a 
stage in the multiplication of a book only 
when it is merged with the making of the 
format copy for a typescript book---that is, 
when a format copy is made directly from a 
draft copy. Whether or not it is profitable to prepare the format copy directly 
from the draft depends on the condition of 
the draft copy, the format chosen, and the 
reproduction technique utilized. 

It costs roughly 20% to 66% more to 
type a format copy in two columns single-spaced from a draft than it costs to type 
a fair copy in one column double-spaced 
from a draft copy. It may cost as much as 
200% more to prepare a complicated format 
copy from a draft copy than it costs to 
prepare a fair copy in ordinary one-column 
format. 

The argument in favor of merging 
the different typing operations is the 
greater the cheaper the reproduction process. Thus the typist who makes a carbon

FIGURE XIX 

The effect of a variation in apparatus and typists' skill 
in the preparation of the format copy for photo-offset work 
is illustrated in this sample page. The page has been printed 
on the same press as the other pages of the book; it would not 
be different from other pages except for the differences in 
the original typings. These differences are exhibited by dividing the page into sections, each section showing the effect of the varying conditions under which the format copy was typed.

 {% include pagebreak.html canvas=91 %} 

copy makes it customarily while preparing 
the fair copy. She does not plan to make 
a fair copy and then retype the whole text 
in order to make a couple of carbons. If 
she is making a hectographed edition, there 
will be more of an excuse for extra typing 
simply because the typing is a smaller proportion of the cost of the whole job. The 
argument is even stronger for a permissible separate format typing in the case of 
mimeograph, and strongest of all in the 
case of the rotaprint, multilith, or photo-offset processes. The shift is not technological, but due to a change in cost perspective. In relation to the expense for 
materials and paper involved in a long run 
on the rotaprint or multilith, the extra 
composition cost of an additional format 
typing seems small, while in relation to 
the corresponding expenses of a run of 
fifty hectographed copies, the additional 
typing charges seem large. Therefore, it 
can be expected that the fair copy will be 
used as format copy more often in hectographing than in mimeographing, and in 
mimeographing more than in offset work. 

## The Preparation of the Format Copy from the Fair Copy
 
Rates for preparing the format copy 
from the fair copy are determined by the 
character of the text and by the format and 
reproduction method chosen. As has been 
said, it takes longer to type technical material than non-technical, and it costs 
more to type in a two-column format than in 
a one-column one. Quotations from Cleveland typing bureaus show that a format copy 
in two columns may be prepared from fair 
copy at an additional charge of about 30%. 
But the reproduction method chosen is the 
chief factor in determining the cost of additional typing: it is just as easy to 
type on a hectograph master sheet as on ordinary typewriter paper and only a little 
more difficult to cut a mimeograph stencil. 
But it is more of an art to prepare master 
copy for photo-offset reproduction. Extra 
care is required on the part of the typist 
in order to produce copy that will retain 
its legibility when its size has been decreased. The best results are obtained 
when certain kinds of master paper and 
typewriter ribbons are used and when special typewriters like the Varityper or the 
Royal photo-offset typewriter are used; 
 {% include columnbreak.html canvas=91 col=2 %} 
these devices and supplies are not available to the author or even to the average 
typing bureau, and it is for this reason 
that photo-offset companies usually prefer 
to have the master copy for photo-offset 
material prepared in their own establishments. The effect of a variation in apparatus and typist's skill in the preparation 
of the format copy for photo-offset is illustrated in Figure XIX. The page has been 
printed on the same press with the other 
pages of the book; it would not be different from other pages except for the differences in the original typing, as indicated 
on the sample page. 

Quotations made by photo-offset establishments for preparing typed master 
copy for photo-offset work range from $.56 
to $1.70 per 1000 words. The usual quotation is about $1.25. The $1.70 figure was 
given for the preparation of a special two-column format with justified lines. One 
company quoted $1.00 per 1000 words for 
technical material in units of several hundred pages. 

As work of this type is definitely 
chargeable as composition, it is interesting to compare these rates with those of 
linotype composition: the wage cost for 
linotype composition at $1.15 per hour 
ranges from $.92 to $1.55 per 1000 words 
according to the number of ems set per hour; 
the shop price of linotype composition at 
$3.50 per machine hour ranges from $2.80 
to $4.67 per 1000 words. 

These possibilities of merging or 
shifting typescript composition costs have 
given rise to some inaccurate thinking on 
the subject of the typescript book. Sometimes a saving in composition cost seems to 
appear like a rabbit out of a magician's 
hat. The topic is sufficiently important 
to warrant further clarifying, which may be 
set up as a formula: 

| If | A is the cost of making fair copy from draft copy | 
|    | B is the cost of making format copy from fair copy and |
|    | C is the cost of making format copy directly from draft copy, |

will it always follow that A plus B is 
greater than C? Will there always be a 
saving in working directly from the draft 
copy? Obviously, the answer depends upon {% include pagebreak.html canvas=92 %} 
the actual condition of the draft copy and 
the rigidity of the requirements of the 
format copy. If the draft copy is in very 
good shape, and the material is to be hectographed or mimeographed in a standard 
typescript format, the two processes may 
well be merged and the extra typing saved. 
But if the draft copy is very rough and the 
format is a complicated one---such as a 
large two-column arrangement with foot- 
notes---to be subjected to photographic reduction and multiplied by photo-offset, the 
intermediate step of making the fair copy 
is necessary. 

In general it should be noted that 
if the author completes a format copy for 
any of the typescript book publication 
processes, he absorbs the entire composition cost of the process, as well as part 
of the editorial expense. This is not a 
true reduction of the publishing costs, but 
a concealed subsidy from the author to the 
publisher. 

The table on the following page 
shows the high variation in typescript com- 
position costs. The spread between low 
and high typescript costs is just as great 
as or greater than the spread between low 
and high linotype costs as analyzed in 
Chapter III. There is no such thing as a 
fixed differential in composition cost as 
between typescript books on the one hand 
and printed books on the other. 

## Area Costs and Format 
### (a) Size of Type 

If the variations in the composition costs of a typescript book are the results of different possibilities in the 
number of times the same matter is to be 
retyped, variations in area costs are responsive to differences in format, to the 
number of words that are laid down on a 
page. 

Three factors control the number of 
words on a page: the size of the type face, 
the interlinear spacing, and the length of 
the line. Except when the Varityper or 
the rare micro-elite and ultra-micro-elite 
machines are used, or the text is multiplied 
by the photo-offset process, the choice as 
to size of type face is limited to pica or 
elite. The special format problems arising 
when photo-offset can be used to reduce {% include columnbreak.html canvas=92 col=2 %} 
typescript will be analyzed in the chapter 
on that process. 

### (b) Interlinear Spacing 

Common to all typescript bookmaking, 
however, is the problem of interlinear 
spacing and length of line. Interlinear 
spacing as a problem in typescript format 
corresponds to leading in relief composition. In normal size typescript the option 
is given between single space and double 
space. The standard ratchet, whether for 
elite or pica type, lays down six lines to 
the inch single-spaced, and three lines 
double-spaced. 

Opinions differ as to the best 
spacing of lines. According to Horde, context is so dominant a factor in legibility 
that no conclusion can be drawn from the 
relative effects of changes in size of type 
and leading; Vernon's work,[^4] on the contrary, has led to a conclusion on spacing---namely, that the best interlinear spacing 
for speed of reading book type is: 

Approximately 
- ⅒ inches (or 7 points) for 12-pt. type. 
- ¹⁄₁₄ inches (or 5 points) for 9-pt. type. 
- ¹⁄₁₇ inches (or 4 points) for 6-pt. type.

If elite typescript is taken as 
the equivalent of 10-point type, the spacing of the ordinary elite typewriter, when 
set for single spacing (six lines to the 
inch) comes very near to the ideal. The 
spacing of pica typescript is too narrow 
when set for single-spacing, too open when 
set for double-spacing. But special ratchets laying down four, five, and five and 
one-half lines to the inch are available for 
the standard typewriters. The price, including installation charges, varies between $1.50 to $5.00.[^5] An elite typewriter 
set single space or a pica typewriter set 
special space (five lines to the inch) 
probably offers the most efficient and legible interlinear spacings. 

[^4]: Vernon, *Experimental Study of Reading* (Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1931). How these spaces are measured 
    is not clear. They probably do not correspond to the leading distances of typography, but ignore the 
    descending letters (f, g, j, p, q, y). The writer has so interpreted them. 

[^5]: Remington, $5.00; Royal, $1.50; Underwood, $5.00; L. C. Smith, $2.25 (Cleveland prices). 

But since the standard typewriter 
equipment does not provide this spacing and 
the elite typewriters are distinctly less 
common than the pica, the most useful information about formats must be worked out 
with the less efficient apparatus, namely, {% include pagebreak.html canvas=93 %}

### (c) Length of Line 

Experimental evidence summarized by 
Vernon shows that the length of a line 
should not be greater than 10cm. or less 
than 7.5cm. (2.9″ to 3.9″). Edwards Brothers in their *Manual of Lithoprinting*[^n6] hold 
that a maximum length of line is determined 
by the formula N 30/72 where N is the type 
size in points---a formula which yields the 
result that 5″--5.8″ is the maximum length 
of line for pica type, 6.4″--4.2″ for elite 
type. These standards yield interesting results when applied to the smaller sizes of 
print or photographically reduced typescript. 
For straight typing in full size they suggest the conclusion which must already have 
come to the minds of many readers---that the 
standard typewriter page 8½″ wide must 
be used with wide margins if the script is {% include columnbreak.html canvas=94 col=2 %} 
to be legible. Since under some conditions 
wide margins are wasteful, there results a 
certain disharmony between the interests of 
economy and legibility in respect of length 
of line. This waste is greater in the case 
of elite typescript, where the interlinear 
spacing is more economical, than in the 
case of pica typescript. The wastefulness 
in length of line can be overcome by setting up a page format in two columns---though this increases composition costs 
even while it reduces area costs.

In the following chapter on carbon 
copying, hectographing, mimeographing, and 
photo-offset reproduction, certain alternative formats will be presented, together 
with the cost differentials that separate 
them. The reader can judge whether the 
difference an legibility is worth the cost.
