## Classification of Special Problems 

{% include pagebreak.html canvas=181 %} The analysis of composition costs 
of printed and typescript books has been 
made on the assumption that the vehicle for 
the recording or communicating of thought 
was to be a text consisting of words written in the Roman alphabet. Under those 
conditions, composition costs follow the 
number of words. Two thousand words cost 
twice as much as 1000 words. 

There are, however, a number of 
variants of this situation, each of which 
affects the computation of costs in their 
relation to quality of product. These variant ways of presenting thought can be 
classified as follows: 

I. Presentation of thought in words and 
numerals. 

A. Words in the Roman alphabet and 
numerals arranged as usual in horizontal lines, but with variations 
in size or body introduced for purposes of emphasis. (Use of italics, bold-face, or smaller point 
size in footnote material.) 

B. Words in the Roman alphabet and 
numerals arranged in vertical as 
well as horizontal lines. (Tabular 
material of all kinds.) 

C. Words interspersed with characters 
not in the Roman alphabet, or numerals not arranged in simple horizontal lines: (Texts that: include 
quoted Greek, treatises with intricate formulae.) 

II. Pictorial presentation of thought. 

A. Black and white drawings. (From 
the standpoint of reproduction 
technique, diagrams, graphs, maps, 
and pictures in black and white 
are the same.) 

B. Photographs or wash drawings. (The 
essential fact is that the reproduction must distinguish different {% include columnbreak.html canvas=181 col=2 %} 
degrees of light and shade; instead of the sharp contrast of 
black and white, there are continuous variations in tone.) 

C. Color reproduction. 

In every case where one of these 
vehicles for the presentation of thought 
is used in connection with a text, the extent of its use may be great or small; 
there may be many footnotes or few, many 
or few Chinese characters may be interspersed, there may be only one or two tabulations in a whole book, or the book may 
consist almost entirely of tabular materials. The pictorial material may be a 
greater or less proportion of the whole 
content of the book, it may be in the form 
of larger or smaller areas, large maps and 
charts, page-size photographs, or small 
pictures or charts filling each only a part 
of a page. 

In respect of all these variants of 
the "normal" Look, the same fundamental 
distinctions hold between large and small 
editions, between running costs of processes like relief printing, which reduce the 
cost of each copy as the size of the edition increases, and of processes like the 
photostat, which have constant costs per 
copy regardless of size of edition.  With 
costs, there are also correlated different 
degrees of legibility in the case of words 
and numerals, and different degrees of 
fidelity of reproduction in the case of 
pictorial matter. There are variations in 
beauty in the final product that follow 
from the adoption of one or another technique, or the assumption of one or another 
cost. There is a cost differential between 
the reproductions of text and picture that 
are sufficiently legible and faithful for 
the accurate transmission of thought, and 
reproductions which go beyond this necessity in order to give aesthetic pleasure 
to the reader. 

{% include pagebreak.html canvas=182 %} The processes already described---relief printing, photo-offset, typescript, 
hectograph, mimeograph, manuscript with 
photo-offset, blueprinting and photostating---all reappear in various combinations 
in the multiplying of materials of these 
various kinds. Descriptions and cost analyses of these processes contained in the 
preceding chapters can be applied to the 
problem presented here. 

## Reproduction in Typescript, Manuscript, and Relief Printing without Pictorial Matter 

When a text consists of words in 
the Roman alphabet, arranged in horizontal 
lines, but with variations in size or body, 
the ordinary typewriter begins to lose efficiency in comparison with the linotype 
or monotype on the one hand and the Varityper on the other. The standard typewriter can introduce only three variations into the form of a text: it can underline 
words or sentences, change the interlinear 
spacing, and change the length of line. 
These variations are usually introduced in 
typescript to set off quoted matter from 
non-quoted matter. They do not always materially increase typescript composition 
costs, and they affect multiplying costs 
of typescript books only in so far as these 
interfere with the use of non-standard interlinear spacing. If the spacing of four 
and one-half or five lines to the inch is 
used with pica typescript, the quoted matter cannot be set off from the regular 
text by reducing the interlinear spacing. 
If footnotes are to be introduced, the composition cost is increased by the need for 
careful calculation to distribute the page 
correctly between the text and footnote. 

The disadvantage of the standard 
typewriter in the preparation of typescript 
material with footnotes for photo-offset 
reproduction can be met to some extent by 
the use of paste pot and shears in the making of the format copy. The footnotes can 
be typed separately with an elite or micro-elite machine, and pasted on the bottom of 
the page of text. 

The Varityper will allow the introduction of a greater number of varieties of typescript faces and the text and 
interlinear spacings. The linotype or 
monotype is still more elastic in this respect. {% include columnbreak.html canvas=182 col=2 %}

Composition costs will sometimes 
increase with the introduction of these variants. To give a quantitative comparison 
of the increase in cost is not practical. 
The differences do not seem to be great 
enough to have decisive influence on the 
choice of techniques, unless (in the case 
of typescript composition) the need for the 
Varityper machine should make it impractical to calculate typescript composition 
costs on any basis save that of the prices 
of format copying offered by photo-offset 
companies. In a particular case these 
shop prices may be so much higher than the 
office costs of standard typescript composition that the change from typescript to 
relief printing would be indicated. 

In the preparation of tabular matter, the linotype or monotype exhibits advantages because it facilitates the centering of text on a page and of the headings 
of columns. The typewriter stands at a 
disadvantage in the preparation of tabular 
material because of the lack of elasticity 
in the size of letters in the headings of 
columns. The mimeoform process is not well 
adapted to the production of tabular material because it does not easily reproduce 
vertical lines. The typewriter also shows 
its limitations when vertical lines on a 
page are desired. 

If tabular material is to be given 
its maximum beauty and clarity, it may call 
for manuscript composition. The kind of 
skill in lettering and numbering that is 
used in the manuscript composition of tabular material is widely available, since it 
is developed by the engineering profession 
and taught in vocational schools as "mechanical drawing." The three techniques available for the reproduction of tabular material are, then, relief printing, typescript 
with or without photographic multiplying, 
and manuscript with some photographic techniques of multiplying (blueprinting, photostating, photo-offset, etc.) 

Cost comparisons are difficult to 
establish among the three kinds of composition of tabular matter. In linotyping, the 
extra charge for tabular matter may run 
from 75% to 600%; in typescript, from 25% 
to 200%; and the cost of manuscript preparation of tables can be guessed from the 
fact that draughtsmen are available at wages of $.60 per hour for ordinary skill and 
$1.00 per hour for high skill, and that {% include pagebreak.html canvas=183 %} their speed is much less than that of a 
typist. 

When words are interspersed with 
characters not in the Roman alphabet, the 
non-Roman characters may happen to be in 
another alphabet (i.e., Greek or Russian) 
that is available as a special matrix for 
the linotype, or as a special type font, or 
a special type plate for the Varityper. A 
font of type sufficient for occasional Russian words in a book costs $30.00 or $40.00; 
a Varityper type plate costs $5.00 in bakelite and $8.50 in metal; a font of Chinese type varies in cost according to completeness. There could be no linotype 
matrix or Varityper type plate for Chinese 
on account of the number of the symbols. 

The only alternative to the use of 
the special matrix, type font, or type 
plate is the use of manuscript. The text, 
as typed or printed in Roman characters, 
can be interspersed with the Chinese or 
other characters by hand. If the whole 
book is to be printed by relief printing, 
these hand-drawn symbols can be made into 
small line cuts, exactly as if they were 
drawings, and filled into the spaces left 
in the linotype or monotype composition; if 
the book is to be reproduced by a photographic technique, they can be drawn in 
place upon the typescript or printed format copy,[^n1] after which no special costs 
will arise. 

[^n1]: Note that in this case a single copy of the book would be printed as page proof, filled in by hand, and then multiplied by photo-offset.

In the case of a *Bibliography on 
Northeastern Asia*, compiled by Professor 
Kerner of the University of California, 
there were 15,500 items, of which 5,000 titles were in the western language; 3,500 in 
Russian; 2,500 in Chinese; and 2,500 in 
Japanese. Letterpress reproduction was out 
of the question because of the high costs 
involved in connection with the foreign 
languages and the small-edition size; 
photo-offset was the ideal process for the 
job. The method proposed in the making of 
the master copy was to have the English 
typed in first, space being gauged and allowed for the other titles. The Russian 
was then to be typed in with a Hammond 
typewriter; these pages in turn were to be 
given over to a student who would write in 
the Chinese and Japanese characters by 
hand, in a size proportionate to the typing. The pages would then be ready to {% include columnbreak.html canvas=183 col=2 %} serve as the master copy for the photo-offset work. Estimates for the composition 
cost of the master copy ranged from $1,200 
to $3,000. 

The need for special equipment and 
special skill in the reproduction of materials with non-Roman alphabet content limits the competition for the work to certain 
specially favored plants. The author himself may be in a position to assume some of 
the composition costs by filling in the 
non-Roman symbols in spaces left for the 
purpose in the typescript or printed composition. This shifting of composition 
cost toward the author is a normal possibility in the production of typescript 
books; it becomes especially important if 
the preparation of the format copy requires 
a rare skill or knowledge that the author 
happens to command, either in himself or 
in his assistants. 

## Techniques in the Reproduction of Pictorial Matter 

There are six fundamental techniques for the reproduction of pictorial 
matter. All of them involve the use of 
photography and hence permit enlargements 
or reductions from the original picture. 
The costs of all of them are fundamentally 
area costs and running costs, for one can 
hardly speak of a composition cost factor 
in the reproduction of pictures. Most of 
them have already been described and analyzed in connection with the reproduction 
of texts. They must here be given further 
description and classification. 

The six fundamental techniques are 
the following: 

1. *Relief processes*. These come up from 
    the original wood-block technique. Ink 
    is carried to paper on the raised part 
    of the printing surface. The standard 
    forms in which this technique appears 
    in small edition book publishing are 
    the zinc cut and the zinc or copper 
    photoengraving. 
2. *Planographic processes*. These are related to the original lithography. A 
    plane surface differentially receptive 
    to ink receives the ink from a roller 
    and transfers it to the paper. Photo-offset is the standard form. {% include pagebreak.html canvas=184 %}
3. *Intaglio processes*. These are variants 
    of etching. Ink is carried to paper in 
    the sunken parts of a metal surface. 
4. *Photogelatin or collotype*. This process bears some resemblance to planographic processes because the printing 
    surface is differentially receptive to 
    ink and moisture, some resemblance to 
    intaglio because there are actually 
    raised parts of the surface that reject 
    ink and depressed parts that receive it. 
5. *Photosensitive paper processes*. These 
    are blueprinting, photostating, and 
    photography. In these processes there 
    is no use of ink. The paper used, for 
    multiplying the pictorial matter is 
    covered over its entire area with a 
    photosensitive surface and then subjected to the action of light and to chemical action that transfers the image to 
    it.
6. *Projection image processes*. These correspond to microcopying. They are the 
    same as those using photosensitive paper 
    except that the image is developed on a 
    transparent medium (glass or film) in a 
    reduced size and then rendered useful 
    by projection on a screen. 

Color production processes are variants of these. They will receive no 
special discussion in this chapter, not 
because they lack importance, but rather 
because their complexity makes analysis of 
costs and results) difficult, and their 
place in the reproduction of materials of 
scholarship is subordinate to that of the 
monochromatic processes. 

In all of these processes there 
are different degrees of fidelity in reproduction of pictorial matter. These differences are of two kinds: differences in 
fineness of detail and differences in fineness or accuracy of tone.

The fineness of detail is primarily a resultant of size. an original picture multiplied in a copy 6″ x 9″ will 
show more detail than the same picture 
multiplied in a copy 3″ x 4 1/2″. But the 
method of reproduction has something to do 
with it. The 3″ x 4 1/2″ copy made by the 
photosensitive paper process on a good bromide paper might show more detail than the 
6″ x 9″ copy made on photostat paper; the 
smaller copy carefully photoengraved with 
a high screening would show more detail {% include columnbreak.html canvas=184 col=2 %} 
than the larger copy done with a low 
screening. These terms will be explained 
below; the essential fact to be established 
at this point is the quality of fineness of 
detail as an element in the reproduction of 
pictorial matter. 

The variations in accuracy or fineness of tone are evident in the first instance in the contrast between a pen and 
ink drawing and a photograph. The pen and 
ink drawing has but two tones---black and 
white; the photograph has a number of intermediate tones. Some processes of reproduction (such as telephoto on newsprint 
paper) will render with recognizable distinctness only three or four tones; photography on a soft bromide paper will render so many different tones that the measure of them is given not by the actual surface of the picture, but by the sensitivity of the human eye to distinctions in 
light intensity. 

Moreover, some processes will show 
the maximum number of distinctions in tone 
in the lighter greys and will cause all the 
darker areas of the picture to take on a 
flat black. This is especially true of the 
photogelatin process. Others will bring 
out very clearly the different tones in the 
darker areas but show few differences of 
shading in the lighter parts. The success 
of a particular process in separating the 
tones of a picture carries with it success 
in exhibiting some kinds of detail. 

Another distinction to be made between these processes is their different 
degrees of adaptability in the combining of 
pictorial and textual matter. The relief 
pictorial processes combine with relief 
printing in the production of books, the 
planographic processes with photo-offset 
printing. Intaglio and photogelatin processes are used for the production of pictorial matter separate from text but are 
capable of being combined with text in a 
bound form. There seems to be no good 
technical reason for not combining photogelatin pictorial work with reproduction of 
text by photogelatin, though the combination has not actually entered trade practice. Pictures made on photosensitive paper can also be bound into books. Only 
pictures made on transparent media for projection are absolutely incapable of combination with text in book form. Any or all 
of these processes can be used to reproduce {% include pagebreak.html canvas=185 %} pictorial matter in a form or size that 
will not be bound with the text in a book 
but will go to the reader of the book as a 
separate item. 

## Photoengraving and Photo-Offset 

The fundamental elements of the 
photo-offset process have been explained 
in the chapter on the reproduction of out-of-print books and have received further 
reference in the chapter on the photo-offset reproduction of typescript books. 

The first part of the photo-offset 
process is the fundamental one in the reproduction of pictorial matter in large 
editions, because it appears not only in 
the production of books by photo-offset, 
but also as an intermediate stage in the 
preparation of line cuts and photoengravings for relief printing. 

The first stage in this process is 
the making of a photographic negative. 
While photolithographers have developed 
the use of film and paper negatives, photoengravers have remained loyal to the wet 
plate process for making negatives. There 
is no technological reason for this; it is 
the result rather of the traditions of the 
craft. 

The photographic negative is then 
transferred to a sensitized metal surface. 
The image is burned on to a zinc sheet 
that has been coated with albumen and ammonium bichromate, the unfixed emulsion is 
washed off, and the zinc surface is inked. 
Up to this point the photo-offset process 
and photoengraving process are the same. 
So far as the chemical quality of the metal surface is concerned, it would be ready 
to be clipped on to a photo-offset press. 
But an additional stage is necessary if 
the metal is to be prepared for relief 
printing. 

The additional step, required for 
the sake of using the relief printing principle, is an application of an acid etch 
to the prepared zinc sheet. The inked 
plate is dusted with powdered resin or 
"dragon's blood," which adheres to the ink 
and falls off the clean metal. The dragon's blood is melted into place by warming 
the zinc. This will protect the printing 
surface from acid. Then the zinc is bathed 
in acid. Repeated baths of acid and coatings of dragon's blood cut away the exposed parts of the plate and leave the pro{%- include columnbreak.html canvas=185 col=2 -%}tected parts as a raised printing surface. 
When the printing surface is prepared in 
this way, it is tacked on a wooden block 
and is then ready to be fitted in with 
linotype slugs or monotype composition in 
a flat-bed press. 

Of course the two processes are not 
in practice as interchangeable as this description might make it appear. The photo-offset worker uses a special thin metal 
sheet, which may be aluminum rather than 
zinc; the photoengraver uses a heavier 
sheet of metal which he will cut up into 
blocks. He may use copper or nickel instead of zinc. The traditions of the two 
crafts are very different, but the chemistry of the process is the same, save that 
the photoengraver must carry out an additional step, namely, the acid etch. 

In the photo-offset process this 
preparation of the printing surface is 
identical for text and for black-and-white 
pictorial matter. In the relief printing 
process the preparation of the printing 
surface for the text by linotype is quite 
different from the preparation of the pictorial printing surface or line cut. Therefore, in relief printing, an additional 
cost: factor must be taken into account---the fitting together of pictorial and textual printing surfaces. This cost factor 
is absent from the photo-offset process. 

## Half-tone Pictures in Photo-Offset and Photoengraving 

Photo-offset and photoengraving 
present the same similarities as and differences from other processes when pictorial matter to be reproduced is not a black-and-white image, but a half—tone picture 
showing different shades of grey. To print, 
whether by photo-offset or relief technique, 
a picture that will show different shades 
of grey requires resort to an optical illusion. 

If a number of small dots on a 
white ground are seen from a reading distance they will appear to run together as 
grey. The grey will be lighter or darker 
according to the density of the dots---that 
is to say, according to the proportion of 
the paper surface they occupy. The tone 
will seem smooth or rough according to the 
size of the dots. The photoengraver or 
photo-offset printer, when he reproduces a 
photograph, renders the greys intermediate {% include pagebreak.html canvas=186 %} between black and white by printing aggregations of dots. The newspaper reproductions of photographs are so coarse that 
they can be analyzed by the naked eye into 
their constituent arrays of dots; there 
are small black dots in the lighter greys, 
larger ones in the darker greys, while in 
the darkest greys the black dots rum together, leaving small white dots between 
them. 

To break the continuous tones of 
an original photograph into a printing surface that will, by putting dots on paper, 
give an illusion of a comparable range of 
tone, the photoengraver or photolithographer prepares his negative in a special way. 
He uses a "screen." The screen is a combination of two sheets of glass, ruled diagonally with opaque lines crossing at 
right angles, and cemented and bound together. When the light passes through such a screen, it reaches the plate in dots and 
so causes the image on the negative to appear in dots also. Four main factors determine these dot formations: the amount 
of light reflected by the copy (i.e., the 
light and shade tones of the photograph 
that is being copied), the size of the openings used in the camera, the distance of 
the screen from the photographic plate, 
and the fineness of the screen. The fineness of the screen is expressed in lines 
to the inch and varies from 45 to 400. 

The screening of the photograph is 
a stage in the preparation of the negative, 
whether wet plate, film, or paper. When 
the screened negative has been prepared, 
the further steps in the process, whether 
for photo-offset or relief printing, are 
identical with the steps that must be taken in the case of black-and-white drawings. 

There has been devised a special 
kind of screen made up of very small lens 
formations stamped in a sheet of heavy 
transparent cellulosic film.) It is said 
that this screen simplifies the work of 
making screened negatives and may therefore reduce the skilled labor element in 
the cost of making screened photographs. 

Half—tones screened up to 100 to 
the inch are made on zinc, above that they 
are usually made on copper, and very fine 
screening is done on nickel. The photo-offset press can reproduce half-tones 
screened as fine as 175, but generally uses screens from 120-150 lines to the inch. {% include columnbreak.html canvas=186 col=2 %} The ordinary photographic work seen in the 
advertising pages of magazines is screened 
120-155 lines to the inch; newspaper 
photographs are screened 45 to 65 lines; 
the aquatone process, a variant of photo-offset, uses screens up to 400 lines to the 
inch.

In general, the finer the screen 
the more faithful will be the reproduction 
of detail. The reader who would appraise 
the effect of refinement in screening upon 
rendition of detail and richness of tone is 
referred to the exhibits bound herewith. 
(Figures XLVI-XLIX.) The photographic work 
on the finer screens is no more costly than 
on the coarse screens, but the printing is 
more difficult. The finer the screen the 
more careful the presswork must be, and the 
smoother the finish of the paper upon which 
it is to be printed. The photo-offset-press does not require the delicate make-ready necessary with highly screened plates 
on a flat-bed press, but the tones rendered 
by the offset method often appear flat in 
contrast with the products of photoengraving. 

## The Large and Small Offset Presses in Pictorial Work 

In Chapter III, on reprinting of 
books, it was stated that there are two 
kinds of photo-offset presses: the large 
press, such as the Harris press, used by 
printers for commercial work; and the smaller presses, such as the rotaprint and multilith, used also as office equipment by 
non-professional operators. In Chapter V, 
on the typescript book, there was included 
a discussion of plate size in connection 
with format, and of the use of direct typing on the metal sheet of the smaller 
photo-offset presses. 

In this chapter, where illustrative 
material is under discussion, it becomes 
necessary to compare the efficiency of the 
large and small presses in respect of fineness of work. Needless to say, the quality 
of a press is reflected in its work in the 
reproduction of books out of print and in 
the reproduction of typescript books; but 
the presswork becomes most important when 
screened photographs are to be reproduced, 
for differences in quality of presswork 
manifest themselves most clearly in the reproduction of half-tones.

FIGURE XLIII

{% include pagebreak.html canvas=193 %} manufacturers of these presses make various 
claims as to the quality of their products. 
To lay the matter objectively before the 
reader, the Joint Committee has taken two 
photographs--an archeological picture and 
a manuscript---and had them both screened at 
85, 133, 150, and 175 lines to the inch. 
This negative, with its four different 
screenings, was then run on the rotaprint 
(Figure XLII), the multilith (Figure XLIII), 
and the Harris press (Figure XLI). The 
differences between fineness of screening 
can be noted by comparing, on the same 
page, the first and last reproductions; the 
differences in presswork, and presumably 
in efficiency of the press, are detected 
by comparing a reproduction in one screening on one press with the reproduction in the same screening on another press. 

## Photogelatin or Collotype 

In the reproduction of half-tone 
pictures, there is an alternative to the 
use of the optical illusion produced by 
the arrangement of dots on a white background. The ink itself may be laid on the 
paper in a surface of varying depth. Anyone who examines a badly printed page of 
type may observe that some of the letters 
are lighter than others because the printer has not given the paper an even pressure on the type metal surfaces; some letters are therefore printed in a lighter 
tone than others. This same principle of 
varying the amount of ink that is laid on 
a paper surface will reproduce half-tones. 
The two techniques that utilize this principle are photogelatin (sometimes called 
collotype) and photogravure. 

In photogelatin printing, as in 
dermaprint, the chemical basis of the process is the action of gelatin and a bichromate under the influence of light. A plate 
of glass or metal that has been ground to 
give it a tooth is covered with gelatin 
that has been made light-sensitive by being 
treated with ammonium bichromate, and is 
rapidly dried with heat. The rapid drying 
leaves the gelatin in a state of strain. 
It is ready, on the slightest provocation, 
to crackle like the paint on a badly 
painted surface. This crackling is called 
"reticulation." At this point photography 
intervenes. 

The sensitized gelatin---covered 
plate in exposed to light in a vacuum {% include columnbreak.html canvas=193 col=2 %} printing frame through a photographic negative. The transparent parts of the negative (i.e., the ones which will print black 
in the finished copy) allow the light to 
tan the bichromated gelatin; the dark parts 
of the negative leave the gelatin untanned. 
When the plate is then developed in water, 
the gelatin crackles or reticulates, because the tanned gelatin on top resists the 
expansion of the soft gelatin below. This 
cracked surface has a crepelike formation 
with more reticulation in the high lights 
and less in the shadows. This grain in 
photogelatin is much finer than the grain 
of a highly screened photoengraving. Moreover, the photogelatin plate does not exhibit, like the photolithographic plate, a 
sharp distinction between the parts that 
will take ink and those that will not. The 
amount of the tanning effect upon the gelatin and the degree of reticulation show 
continuous gradations from those parts of 
the plate that have received most light to 
those that have received least. 

When the photogelatin plate has 
been exposed and developed, it is moistened 
with a mixture of glycerine and water before being inked. The glycerine—water mixture does two things: first, it swells the 
untanned parts of the gelatin surface so 
that they rise slightly higher than the 
tanned and reticulated parts. This permits 
the ink to lie more heavily in the parts of 
the plate that have received most light 
during exposure under the photographic negative. Because of this slight difference 
in height of printing surface, the process 
is sometimes called an intaglio process. 

The second thing done by the glycerine-water mixture is more in line with 
photolithographic principles. Since the 
raw glycerine absorbs more moisture than 
the tanned gelatin, it is less receptive 
to ink. The soft gelatin acts like the 
moistened metal surface of the photolithographic plate, taking water and rejecting 
ink. The supply of moisture on the gelatin 
is not replenished from any water roller, 
but from the air. The glycerine picks up 
the moisture from the air. 

The photogelatin plate will not 
make as many impressions as the photolithographic plate. When the gelatin is laid 
on glass, it lasts for about 5000 impressions; when laid on aluminum, for 5000 to 
10,000 impressions. Because of the short {% include pagebreak.html canvas=194 %} life of the plate, the photogelatin process is not suited to long runs. 

In the photogelatin technique, 
photographs are reproduced without screening. This fact may result in lower costs 
than would appear in photoengraving or even 
in photo-offset of screened photographs. 

Another peculiarity of the photogelatin technique is the ability to reproduce pictures printed as photoengravings. 
It is very difficult to make a new screened 
photoengraving from a published half-tone, 
because the light from the aggregation of 
dots in the half-tone does not behave in 
the screening like light from an original 
photograph or wash drawing. If an author 
wishes to use from a published book a 
photoengraved illustration, he can secure 
a much more accurate copy with the photogelatin technique than with the photoengraving or photo-offset technique. In a 
series of history books, The Rise of Modern 
Europe, the firm of Harper Brothers used 
photogelatin for the reproduction of illustrations. The use of this process has made 
it much easier than it would otherwise be 
to gather the illustrative material, because pictures could be copied without going back to the photographs from which the 
photoengraved prints were made. 

The presses used in the photogelatin process are of two types: the rotary 
presses, taking large flexible metal sheets 
(usually aluminum); and the flat-bed presses, which use a thick sheet of glass. The 
dimensions of these presses vary. The Continental Lithograph Corporation of Cleveland has rotary presses 44″ x 64″; the 
Meriden Gravure Company of Meriden, Connecticut, uses a flat-bed press 28″ x 39″. 

The principle explained in connection with the photo-offset process, that 
that format is least costly which uses the 
largest proportion of the available printing surface area with least wastage, ap- 
plies equally to photogelatin. 

The photogelatin process, primarily 
used for illustrations either in book publications or in posters, could be adapted 
to the reproduction of textual matter. 
There is no technological obstacle to the 
preparation of copy for the photogelatin 
process in the form of typescript text and 
unscreened photographic prints or negatives. 
Two full—tone collotype reproductions are 
shown herewith (Figure XLIV, XLV). Note {% include columnbreak.html canvas=194 col=2 %} also the enlargement of microcopied print 
in Chapter XI, Exhibit LXITI. 

The limitation imposed upon this 
process by the rapid wearing out of the 
printing surface has influenced the use of 
the process commercially. But this limitation is more like an advantage when the 
process is considered in connection with 
the reproduction of research materials, for 
the accountancy and trade practices of the 
photogelatin shop have adapted themselves 
to the short runs that are common to all 
research publications. 

## Intaglio Processes: Photogravure 

All intaglio printing processes use 
a metal plate in which shallow depressions 
receive ink, which is then transmitted to 
paper, making a darker tone where the depression is deepest, and a lighter tone 
where the depression is slight. 

The photogravure process is a 
photochemical intaglio technique. A smooth 
sheet of copper is first given a very fine 
dusting with powdered asphaltum or resin. 
When this fine dust is baked on to the 
plate it furnishes a protective grain, comparable to the grain that appears in the 
photogelatin process when the gelatin 
reticulates under the influence of the 
light. 

Then a film of bichromated gelatin 
is laid on the copper plate and printed on 
the same principle as that which is used 
in the photogelatin process, except that 
in this case it is printed from a positive 
photograph instead of a negative. The 
light therefore hardens the gelatin in 
those parts of the picture that are to be 
light, and leaves it soft in those parts 
of the picture that are to be dark. The 
copper plate is then put into an acid bath, 
which quickly eats away the soft gelatin 
and gets to work on the copper; but its action on the copper is slower to the degree 
that the hardening of the gelatin (as an 
effect of light) has slowed it down. Thus 
the copper plate will emerge from the process with depressions that are deepest in 
those areas which correspond to the dark 
places in the positive photograph and 
slightest in the places that correspond to 
the light places in the original photograph.

One of the advantages of the photogravure method over others is the ease 
with which the plate can be retouched by 
The shadows can be darkened, for 
instance, by deepening the depressions in 
the copper. 

## Aquatone and Pantone 

Two variants of the photo-offset 
process should be mentioned at this time. 
One of them is the aquatone process, a 
planographic process that produces remarkably faithful reproductions of photographs 
from a gelatin plate. It is not a widely 
used process, Edward Stern and Company, 
Inc., of Philadelphia being the only establishment the author knows of that does 
this kind of work,[^n2] but it makes very fine 
reproductions. It has many similarities 
to the photogelatin method. An example of 
aquatone work is displayed herewith (Figure L). 

[^n2]: Edward Stern and Company, Inc., has made available an excellent booklet, "What Is Aquatone?" which gives a detailed description of the process. 

The aquatone plate is made of a 
thin sheet of zinc. Edward Stern and Company, Inc., uses a 45″ x 54″ plate for its 
presses. To furnish a base for the gelatin coating, the zinc sheet is "grained" 
with quartz; the gelatin is then applied, 
set, and washed in a hardening solution. 
For further hardening, the plate is baked 
to 200° F. A bichromate sensitizer is 
used to make the gelatin light sensitive, 
and then the plate is put in a printing 
frame in contact with the illustration it 
is desired to reproduce. 

The illustration to be reproduced, 
which has been stripped onto a sheet of 
glass, is pressed into close contact with 
the plate, and the printing is accomplished 
by exposure of the sensitive plate to a 
strong arc lamp. The light makes the sensitized gelatin which has been exposed become impervious to water and alcohol. When 
the printing stage is passed, water and 
alcohol are used to develop the plate; 
this water and alcohol solution removes 
the unaffected bichromate and leaves a 
positive image. A second baking toughens 
the gelatin and gives it a longer life on 
the press. The plate is now ready to be 
run. 

During all this preparatory work, 
cleanliness, controlled temperature condi{%- include columnbreak.html canvas=209 col=2 -%}tions, and precision are essential for good 
results. 

The plate is fastened to a cylinder 
and fed water during each revolution by a 
water roller. The average plate runs about 
20,000 impressions, but a run of 30,000 or 
more is quite possible. Only the gelatin 
that has *not* been affected by the light 
will absorb the water; therefore, when the 
ink rollers come into contact with the cylinder, the ink is repelled by the dampened 
gelatin and attracted by the dry positive 
image. The rubber blanket cylinder, receiving the ink that has been deposited on the 
plate, comes in turn in contact with the 
impression cylinder and brings the paper 
into position for receiving the ink impression. 

Offset paper with a very hard 
rough surface is best suited for aquatone 
work. 

The cost of aquatone work compares 
with that of fine offset work. 

The second variant is the pantone 
or mercury process. Pantone is a complicated process designed to make use of a 
principle similar to that of photolithography to prepare a printing surface which 
will stand long rums and be very resistant 
to wear. It makes use of the fact that 
chromium is a hard metal which will accept 
and transfer ink, while mercury will re- 
fuse ink. The chromium serves instead of 
the grease of primitive lithography; the 
mercury takes the place of water on the 
wet surface of the stone. 

Although this process is not useful in cheapening small editions, it is 
interesting as an illustration of the variety of techniques which can be used in 
printing. A sheet of iron is coated with 
a thin surface of copper and a very thin 
surface of chromium on top of the copper, 
and then a photographic emulsion on top of 
the chromium. The text is transferred to 
the plate in the usual photolithographic 
method, and the parts of the metal which 
ordinarily receive water are etched with 
acid through the chromium to the copper. 
Silver is then deposited on the plate and 
adheres to the copper but avoids the chromium. The mercury is rubbed over the plate, 
and the mercury amalgamates with the silver. {% include pagebreak.html canvas=210 %} The result is an all-metal plate which will 
print without using the raised-type principle. Related processes are the Renck and 
Porte methods. 

Some efforts have been made to use 
the mercury process for combining the 
photolithographic principle with the mechanics of the flat-bed press. The process is also used with the offset press. It 
has no immediate practical importance in 
connection with the problems of reproducing research materials. 

## Dermaprint 

The dermaprint stencil method has 
been described in connection with the reproduction of out-of-print books. It is 
the coarsest of the multiplying techniques 
that utilize the photographic principle. 
The dermaprint stencil will reproduce 
line drawings, but in the reproduction of 
screened pictures it will take only the 
coarsest screens. Dermaprint screening is 
not even as fine as the screening used in 
newspaper work. 

## Photosensitive Paper Processes 

Illustrations can be copied by the 
various blueprinting techniques, by photostat, and by photographic printing on bromide paper. The differences in quality are 
not unlike those differences that appear 
in the other techniques: they are differences in the accuracy in the rendition of 
detail, and differences in faithfulness in 
the reproduction of tones. The so-called 
"soft" bromide papers give the widest 
range of tones; hard bromide papers and 
photostat papers offer a much reduced range, 
and the blueprint types of paper offer even 
less tone variety. The variation in accuracy in the rendering of detail is the 
same: the bromide prints are most accurate and the blueprints least accurate. 
The costs naturally are in reverse order. 
In making cost comparisons, two 
types of material should be distinguished: 
those requiring only black-and-white contrast and those requiring half-tones. 

## Cost Comparisons 

The starting point of cost comparisons must be a picture of a given area reproduced in editions of varying size. The 
dimensions of the picture chosen for this 
first comparative table are 4″ x 6″ because {% include columnbreak.html canvas=210 col=2 %} a picture of this size can be used in an 
ordinary octavo 6″ x 9″. It is assumed, moreover, that 100 illustrations of 
identical size are required. The book here 
described is, therefore, a book of 100 pages of pictorial material, consisting of 6″ 
x 9″ pages with pictorial matter 4″ x 6″ on 
each page. 

This crude comparison indicates 
that in size of edition the processes that 
operate by diminishing costs (photo-offset, 
photoengraving, photogelatin, photogravure) 
begin to become cheaper than the processes 
involving more constant costs (blueprint, 
photostat, bromide photographs) when the 
edition is between 50 and 100 copies. But 
there are a number of other variables to be 
considered. These variables relate both to 
cost conditions and quality conditions. 

One variation in cost conditions 
has to do with the number of different pictures reproduced. If the specifications 
called for the reproduction of only one or 
five or twelve pictures instead of a hundred, would there be a substantial modification of the cost relationships that appear on the foregoing table? If the pictorial matter were in larger pictorial surfaces or smaller pictorial surfaces, would 
the processes still stand in the same cost 
order? 

The information needed to answer 
these questions accurately is not at hand. 
There are, however, certain concrete quotations which can be set down and then compared in so far as they are comparable. All 
the diminishing cost techniques are represented, for quotations have been given by 
a firm specializing in photogravure and a 
firm specializing in photogelatin, and 
photoengraving prices are highly standardized. These quotations are taken to 
cover different sizes of picture and different sizes of page, according to the 
table on page 92. 

## Combination of Pictorial and Textual Matter 

The full complexity of the cost 
analysis of the reproduction of pictorial 
matter does not appear until allowance is 
made for the different ways in which pictures may be combined with text. 

The simplest situation is that of 
the photo-offset book illustrated with 
black-and-white drawings, charts, or maps. {% include pagebreak.html canvas=211 %}

Here the pictorial material is simply combined with the format copy, and no further effect upon cost is felt. 

Whenever pictorial material is to 
be combined with relief printing, the cost 
of fitting the type around the photoengraved blocks must be met. 

When half-tone work is combined 
with text in photo-offset the cost of the 
screening must be added to the normal cost 
of photo-offset book production. 

Consider the situation of an author who has written a book and wishes to 
illustrate it. He has gathered as illustrations either drawings or photographs. 
The photographs may be original prints or 
copies from printed photoengravings. He 
now wishes to determine the process to be 
used in publishing. 

If his edition is to be less than 
fifty, he will probably fare best if he 
makes up a typescript book by one of the 
processes and in one of the formats discussed in Chapter V, and then has the {% include columnbreak.html canvas=215 col=2 %} photographic material duplicated by a blueprint or bromide-print process. In binding his book, he will simply gather the 
illustrative sheets with the typescript 
pages and have them bound in place. 

If the edition is larger, he may 
wish to take advantage of the law of diminishing costs in larger editions and to set 
up his book for reproduction by printing, 
photo-offset, or photogelatin. He will 
then wish to decide whether the illustrative material should be fitted in with the 
text or reproduced as separate pages. The 
variables are so numerous that it will not 
be possible to set forth here the definite 
costs that may be involved in any decision. 

The most important distinction 
must be made between the drawings, which 
are to be done in black and white, and the 
tone pictures, which must be reproduced to 
show the intermediate tones. The next 
most important decision lies between publication of illustrations on separate pages or on the same pages with the text.

For the drawings the author has two 
choices: he may elect relief printing with 
zinc line-cuts, or photo-offset from typescript. For the toned illustrations, he 
may choose photoengraving with printing, 
photo-offset from typescript with screened 
illustrations, or photogelatin. 

Note that in all these processes 
the stage in book production is reached 
after which the presence of illustrative 
material adds nothing to costs. In the 
printing process this stage does not arrive 
until the entire first cost is met and the 
press is ready to run; in the case of 
photo-offset of drawings, or photogelatin 
of drawings or half tones, the stage is 
reached when the photographic negative is 
trued up; in the case of photo-offset of 
half tones it is reached when the screening 
is completed. The whole process of etching {% include columnbreak.html canvas=216 col=2 %} on metal and fitting metal to type is a 
part of a relief-printing cost, but not of 
a photo-offset or photogelatin cost. 

If the area cost of photogelatin 
work were the same as area cost of photo-offset, this process would be indicated for 
all combinations of photographs with text. 
Since the prices for this process are not 
highly standardized, an accurate table indicating the amount of screened photography 
in relation to the amount of text that 
would make photogelatin the favored process cannot be made. But the conclusion 
will probably stand that if the amount of 
text (i.e., the page area covered by text) 
is small enough in comparison with the area 
covered by pictorial matter, photogelatin 
will stand out as the best technique for 
the reproduction of an illustrated work, 

It must be emphasized again that in {% include pagebreak.html canvas=217 %} reproduction of illustrations, as in 
all cases where area costs predominate, the 
costs are increased as the size of the illustrations is increased, and diminished as their size is diminished. The alternatives 
confronting the author in this case are the 
same as those which confront him in the reproduction of the text itself, whether it 
is a reprint of an out-of-print book or a 
typescript book reproduced by photo-offset: 
he can always cut costs by sacrificing 
size, and with size, beauty and legibility. 

There is another way in which pictorial and textual matter may be combined. 
The pictorial matter may be separately 
printed and then combined with the textual 
matter in the course of the bookbinding 
process. 

The effect of this method of combining text and picture is to convert it 
into a running cost, for the cost of binding varies almost directly with the number 
of copies bound, and the cost of inserting 
extra pictures of sheets while gathering 
the folded pages of a book varies almost 
directly with the number of copies and the 
number of insertions per copy. 

it is not excluded that the author 
should have recourse to microcopying to lay 
illustrative material before his reader. A 
text might be issued in an edition of appropriate size, and the illustrative material to go with it reproduced as a strip 
of film, to be used by projection on a 
screen or in a reading machine. The cost 
levels at which such films can be manufactured and distributed will be discussed 
in Chapter XII; it need only be noted at 
this point that the technique is at hand, 
and that it might lead to a practice of 
far more copious pictorial illustrations 
than the scholarly world has as yet dreamed 
of using. {% include columnbreak.html canvas=217 col=2 %}

## Summary 

The reproduction of pictorial matter, like the texts, can be accomplished at 
costs varying over a wide range and permitting sales at normal prices or prices not 
greatly in excess of normal, in editions 
varying through all the ranges of the possible scholarly market, from that which is 
presented by the few largest research libraries to that which just falls short of 
the requirements of the commercial publisher. 

That which is usually spoken as the 
"cost" of publishing a book, whether illustrated or not, whether in ordinary Roman 
characters or not, is only a special instance of a great range of possible costs. 
It is usually the cost of applying a relief-printing technique to the distribution of 
an intellectual product to a non-commercial 
market. The difference between the probable income from a full, normal, commercial 
market and the anticipated income from an 
actual scholarly market is usually made up 
as a subsidy to the press, which has made 
no technological concessions to the situation. The press publishes as if the book 
were to be sold to 2000 or more buyers and 
asks the sponsors of the publication to relieve it of the financial consequences of 
proceeding on this fiction. 

True it is that scholars are not 
yet accustomed to books in typescript, illustrations in blueprint, nor to many of 
the varieties of product that technology 
now puts at their disposal. If they can 
but accommodate themselves to the new techniques, important barriers to intellectual 
intercourse can be made to fall.
