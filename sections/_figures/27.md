FIGURE XXVII 

This sample page is to illustrate the use of special interlinear spacing and the use of a wax stencil. The interlinear spacing used is five lines to the inch; the stencil used 
is the inexpensive wax stencil costing $.05¼ each, instead of 
the usual Mimeotype stencil costing $.13½ each. 

The length of run that is possible with the wax stencil 
is much less than that which can be obtained with the Mimeotype stencil, possibly 300 copies being the limit. 

The preparation of the wax stencil printing surface is 
no more difficult than the Mimeotype printing surface. The 
chief danger is the creasing of the wax sheet, which would result in ink being squeezed through the abraded parts. Corrections are made in the usual manner.
