FIGURE XXVIII 

This is a sample page done with micro-elite type. In this format, 800 words are 
contained on one page. Compare this figure 
with Figure XXVII, containing 400 words per 
page and using special interlinear spacing. 

To mimeograph a book of 100,000 words 
in this format would mean tremendous savings 
in stencil cost and paper cost. Composition 
cost would, of course, be no less, and might 
even be somewhat more expensive, due to the 
two-column arrangement. 

The inference, of course, is obvious: 
there is a close tieup between cost and legibility. The more money that is put into a 
job, the more likely it is that the resulting product will have greater legibility and 
be more pleasing to the eve. This brings up 
the problem of how we are to determine the 
exact point at which cost, legibility, and 
beauty of appearance come together in the 
best balance. This problem has not yet received its final analysis. It is known, 
however, that beyond a certain point there 
is no need to spend more money for increased 
legibility, because the factor of legibility 
has already reached its maximum point, and a 
more expensive format would add to nothing 
except, perhaps, the printer's profit. 

In order to exhibit as many as possible 
of the different varieties of the mimeograph 
process, sample pages have been run off on 
various paper stocks from Rotaprint and Multilith metal sheets, and from Vimeotype and 
wax stencils. The reader must make allowance for the fact that paper stocks, formats 
and processes are all on display, and must 
decide for himself which differences in the 
sample pages are due to format variables, 
which to paper, and which to the reproduction methods.

The mimeograph process multiplies typescript by means of a stencil printing surface 9n which the letters of the format copy 
are cut by the typewriter; the stencil is 
fastened on a cylinder. and as sheets of papae are fed into the machine. an impression 
is produced on the copy paper by the squeezing of ink through the abraded portions of 
the stencil. Mimeograph equipment ranges in 
price from $30.00 to $375.00 for hand-run 
models, and from $255.00 to $450.00 for the 
electrically operated models with automatic 
feed. The preparation of the printing surface is almost as simple as ordinary tvpewriting, so that, although this form of duplication is commercially available through 
service agencies, almost every office of any 
size possesses its own Mimeograph machine. 

The Rotaprint and the Multilith have 
been mentioned in connection with the discussion of photo-offset as a reprinting 
method. The press plates for reprinting are 
prepared photographically, of course, but 
there is an alternative way of putting on 
such plates the format cooy of the text to 
be reproduced. The metal sheets that are 
used on these small offset presses can be 
inserted in a typewriter as if they were 
sheets of paper, to receive typescript directly. The making of typescript books from 
press plates prepared in this manner may 
perhaps be called "direct typing" offset, as 
compared with photo-offset. It is much less 
common than photo-offset, but also much less 
expensive, and it is therefore worthy of consideration by any institution possessing sufficient resources to purchase a Rotaprint or 
a Multilith for either commercial or non-commercial use. 

From the standpoint of cost behaviour, 
mimeographing and direct typing offset are 
very closely related. Thev will therefore 
be referred to in this report as the "mimeograph" techniques, and their costs will 
be analyzed together.
