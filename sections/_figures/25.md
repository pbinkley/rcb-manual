Direct typing on a Rotaplate is done by using either 
a special Rotaprint carbon paper in the typewriter, a 
Rotaprint "G" ribbon, or a Royal Photo-offset typewriter 
using carbon ribbon which does not require any preparatory 
treatment, is placed in the typewriter the same as a sheet 
of paper. In the typing, a very light impression against 
the Rotaplate should be made; a hard platen that will give 
a sharp outline of the characters is best. Errors are corrected in the usual manner. 

When the typing is done, the sheet is dusted with a 
special Rotaprint powder. A small amount of liquid solution is then poured on the sheet and spread over the surface with a piece of cotton. The excess fluid is wiped 
off, leaving a thin coating on the surface. The Rotaplate 
is now ready to be used on the machine. It can be filed 
indefinitely. 

One Rotaplate will make 25,000 or more copies. The 
Rotaplate used for this work costs $.20. 

This sample page of direct typing Rotaprint work can 
be compared with Figure XXVI, which illustrates direct 
typing on a Multilith machine.
