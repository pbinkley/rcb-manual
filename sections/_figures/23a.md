This is a sample page made by the hectograph liquid 
process on a Standard New Process machine costing $187.00. 
This is the **74** copy from the master sheet. To produce a 
book of 50,000 words by this process, using this format, 
would cost $60.00 for an edition of 100 copies (not including binding). The carbon used for this page, New Process 
Duplicating carbon paper, costs $4.50 in quantities of 100 
sheets, with reductions in price as the quantity increases. 

A comparison of this page with Figure XXIIIb will give 
the reader an opportunity to observe the legibility of 
copies taken from two different places in runs; an examination of Figure XXII (the product of the gelatin hectograph 
process) will bring out the main points of difference 
between the products of the two hectograph methods. 

Standard Duplicator copy paper, used for this work, 
costs $1.60 per 1000 sheets, with reductions in price starting at the 10,000 mark. It is a 20# highly absorbent paper 
manufactured especially for hectograph work. 

The BX Duplicating fluid used with the Standard New 
Process machines costs $2.75 a gallon in six gallon lots,
$3.25 a gallon for smaller quantities. A gallon will 
moisten at least 6,000 copies, or as many as 10,000.
