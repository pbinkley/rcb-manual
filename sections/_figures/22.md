This sample page has been made on a Standard Rotary
Duplicator, a gelatin machine. It is claimed that as many 
as 200 legible copies may be obtained from one master
sheet. This is the 84 copy from the master sheet. The
gelatin film is made in a 9" x 15" size and is placed in
the machine much the same as a stencil is placed on the
drum of a Mimeograph machine. The gelatin *film* is not
subjected to the strain of winding and unwinding, such as 
is necessary with the gelatin *roll*.

Gelatin cost is determined by several factors, among
them being the number of copies run, the length of the 
run, the quality of work desired, and the color used. It
is claimed that the Standard Duplicator film can be used
for a total run of 4,000 sheets before it is worn out.
If red ink is used, the film or roll will wear out much
faster than if purple ink is used. Gelatin cost is not
as constant a cost factor as hectograph fluid cost. 

The methods of making master sheets for all types of
gelatin machines are pencils, ink, ribbons, and carbon. 
All of these methods may be combined in a single master
sheet which will reproduce copies at one operation. Ribbon 
cost is governed by the number of words, while carbon
cost is determined by page area.
