Briefly stated, the outstanding advantages 
of this method are: 

A tremendous reduction in space required to 
house newspaper files. The film record requires 
less than 2% of the storage space required by 
the original bound volumes. 

The film record is a much more permanent one 
than the present bound volumes. This record 
can be renewed as desired thus preserving the 
files indefinitely. 

The files can be referred to much more easily 
with the new method. They can be retained 
where they are immediately available and the 
moving about of large bound volumes is 
eliminated. 

The cost is exceedingly small = being only 
1-⅕¢ per page for standard size newspaper 
pages. Consequently 1,000 pages will cost 
only $12.00 which is little more than the 
present binding cost.
