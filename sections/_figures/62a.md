FIGURE LXIIa 

This page was reduced 16 diameters. When so reduced, it was a rectangle the size of this figure: The two upper squares on the page 
were then enlarged back exactly 16 diameters. The two lower squares 
on the page were enlarged back 32 diameters, because the clipping 
and the typescript had been reduced to 50% of original size by 
photo-offset before they were again reduced by photography; 
therefore the total microphotographic reduction was 32 diameters, and an enlargement of 32 diameters was necessary to bring them back to full size.

---The Victorian Council Against

The deputation declared it had

ernment would be the first to make 
war. Italy had been declared the 
aggressor in this war and unless 
the consul sent the council's for- 
mal protest to Italy, steps would

This page was sent to various photographers as a test sheet; this original 
is here reproduced directly by the photo-offset process; the following exhibit, Figure LXIIb, has been passed through a reduction of sixteen diameters and an enlargement of sixteen and thirty-two diameters.
