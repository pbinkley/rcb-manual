The effect of a variation in apparatus and typists' skill 
in the preparation of the format copy for photo-offset work 
is illustrated in this sample page. The page has been printed 
on the same press as the other pages of the book; it would not 
be different from other pages except for the differences in 
the original typings. These differences are exhibited by dividing the page into sections, each section showing the effect of the varying conditions under which the format copy was typed.
