AN ECONOMICAL PRINT-FACE FORMAT 

In order to secure an economical print-face format, various factors must be 
taken into consideration. Among these are the compactness and size of the 
type-face, the amount of leading, and the width of the margins. 

In discussing type-sizes and type-faces, it may be well to know of the graduated or uniform scale for measuring type which is now used by American 
type-founders. This scale is known as the point system. The unit of the system is a division of space called a point, which is .013837 or ¹⁄₇₂ of an inch. 
All type sizes are multiples of this unit of measurement. The smallest type 
generally used is 5-point or Pearl. 6-point or Nonpareil and 8-point or Brevier are frequently used for footnotes in monographic work. 7-point or 
Minion is commonly used for newsprint. 10-point or Long Primer is best 
suited for regular book composition. Examples of these type-sizes can conveniently be found by looking under "type" in *Webster's International Dictionary of the English Language*. The use of a type-size smaller than 10-point 
effects an economy in make-up and make-ready but not in composition, for 
a given manuscript will require approximately the same number of "ems" 
in various sizes of type. 

As a given font of type has an exact point-size in its depth, so the individual 
characters of that font have a definite width of "set." The average width of 
the character "m" in a type-face is as great as its depth; in a word, the letter 
"m" is exactly square. This is the case in commonly used type-faces like Caslon Old Style, Scotch Roman and Modern, where in 10-point the set size of 
the letter "m" is also 10 points. In a compact type-face, like the one used for 
this composition, the set size of the letter "m" is only 9½ points, with all other 
characters having a corresponding compactness. By the use of this type-face, 
known as Granjon, a considerable saving can be effected in composition costs 
if these are reckoned up by multiplying the width by the length of the line. 
If composition costs are determined by the number of key-strokes instead of 
the amount of type matter, this type-face would effect a saving not in composition costs, but in area costs only. 

Excessive leading is not compatible with good value in book-making, and 
should be prevented, if possible, by instructions by the publisher to the printer. 
The type of this page is leaded one point; in a word, 11-point type is cast 
on a 12-point body. 

Much space is often wasted in margins. The formula for margins given by 
Gress<sup>1</sup> calls for top and back margin to be equal; the outside to be equal 
to the top plus one-third of the back margin; and the bottom to be equal to 
the outside margin plus two picas (or about one-fourth inch). This formula 
is followed in the format here illustrated. 

This page format has been designed by the R. R. Donnelley & Sons Company of Chicago as one taking account of the economies possible in page
