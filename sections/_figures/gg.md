difference is that this film is perforated on only one edge, thus allowing more 
usable area on the same total width. One foot of film negative carries eight and 
a fraction newspaper pages or approximately 825 to 850 pages on 100 feet of 
film. The pages are arranged lengthwise on the film. 

THE CAMERA. 

The camera, which might more properly be called a photographing machine, 
is almost wholly automatic in action. The newspapers to be photographed are 
fed in one page at a time, very much as sheets are fed into a cylinder press or 
mimeograph. Since the photographing of an entire month's edition will require 
only thirty minutes, more or less, it would hardly pay any newspaper to purchase 
one of these cameras. Newspaper publishers ship the month's file of newspapers to 
Rochester each month and pay for the negative film at a price of 10 cents per foot. 
If more than one film is desired from the same lot of papers, duplicates are made 
at a cost of 5 cents per foot. These prices cover the film itself as well as the items 
of exposure and development. This charge for the first negative is equivalent to 
1⅕ cents per page, and for the positive duplicate copies, ⅗ of a cent per page. 

A reel of one hundred feet of film occupies a storage space 1⅝x3¾x3¾ 
inches and carries at least 850 newspaper pages. When asked concerning the life 
of the film, Mr. Case replied that no one really knows how long a negative film 
will last, as none has yet become useless from age. It may last 100 years or 
more. As it is a comparatively simple and inexpensive matter to duplicate the film 
at any time, the length of life of film is not really a vital matter. Mr. Case also 
stated that bound volumes of old issues can be reproduced and preserved by this 
method, but that to do so it would be necessary to take the volumes apart. 

THE PROJECTOR. 

The projector or viewing device is shown in the accompanying illustration. 
The base measures approximately 15 by 18 inches, and the total height is a 
little over 3 feet. The reel of film is mounted on a carrier on top of the apparatus, 
as shown, and is unwound and rewound as desired by means of a crank mounted 
on the right side of the casing, as is shown in the illustration. Since the pages are 
arranged in consecutive order on the film, any page desired may be easily and 
quickly located. The projector shows both 16 and 35 mm. film, 

In the base of the projector is a roll of dull surfaced paper 15 inches wide. 
The free end of this roll is pulled over the base and forms the screen upon which 
the film pictures are projected. As the surface becomes soiled a clean section is 
pulled down and the soiled portion is torn off. The screen shows one-quarter of 
a newspaper page at a time. 

It will be noticed from the illustration that four columns of an 8-column 
page are visible. The knob and lever mounted on the left side of the case are 
employed for shifting the film, carrier and optical system forward or backward or 
to right or left so as to bring into the field of view the exact portion of the page 
which the operator desires to read. Records photographed on 16 mm. film appear 
in their entirety on the screen. The source of light is a 200-watt lamp protected 
by a guard as shown. The apparatus is designed to prevent injury to the film by 
heat, no matter how long the film may be exposed to the light of the lamp. The 
cabinet protects the image on the screen from interference by extraneous light 
sources, thus allowing the projector to be used in any room under normal lighting 
conditions. 

If a copy of any particular article or story is desired, this can be obtained 
photographically by laying a piece of photographic paper on the screen so that 
the sensitized surface receives the image. If a print of a whole page is desired, 
this may be made from the negative by the process commonly employed for making 
enlarged photographic prints. The price of the projector is $185.00. 

Newspapers in various parts of the country are now photographing their 
editions by the Recordak method and are using Recordak Library Projectors for 
reading the film. Several libraries are now using film copies of newspapers that 
they ordinarily kept on their shelves in bound form. The use of film copies 
materially reduces the space required to house the bound volumes, eliminates the {% include pagebreak.html canvas= 285 %} cost of binding and provides a permanent record. These libraries are using 
Recordak Library Projectors for reading from the films. 

Recently the Recordak Corporation photographed the editions of the New 
York Times from January 1, 1914, to December 31, 1918. Positive copies of this 
New York Times film for the 5 years of the World War have been ordered by a 
number of libraries. The cost of the film copies for the entire 5 years is $433.74. 
Individual years may be purchased if desired.
