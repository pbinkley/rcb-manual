This page was reduced 16 diameters. When so reduced, it was a rectangle the size of this figure: The two upper squares on the page 
were then enlarged back exactly 16 diameters. The two lower squares 
on the page were enlarged back 32 diameters, because the clipping 
and the typescript had been reduced to 50% of original size by 
photo-offset before they were again reduced by photography; therefore the 
total micro-photographic reduction was 32 diameters, and an enlargement of 32 
diameters was necessary to bring them back to full size.
