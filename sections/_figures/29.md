Exhibit to illustrate the comparative legibility of typescript and print 
face when they are so set or reduced that they lay the same amount of 
reading matter on the same area. 

It is worth noting that among those 
who have studied the subject there 
is by no means a general agreement 
as to the effects of line lengths, 
type faces, type sizes, and leading 
upon the reading rate of a given material. Very little has been done 
to show how typescript compares with 
print face in legibility. While the 
effects of variations in line lengths 
and type sizes in printed matter have 
been experimentally tested by Tinker 
and Paterson, it is with great caution that their evidence must be applied in recommending line lengths 
and photographic reductions of typescript.
