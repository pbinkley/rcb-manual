This page is a sample of the hectograph work made 
with No.3-M Ormig carbon costing $4.00 per 100 sheets, with 
a reduction in price for larger quantities. This is the **129** 
copy from the master sheet.

Ormig duplicators range in price from $165.00 to 
$285.00 for the hand operated machines, and $395.00 to 
$495.00 for the electrically operated machines. The V-5
models take maximum size sheets 9" X 14" and the larger 
models V-6 takes sheets up to 14" by 17". 

The Ormigtin (liquid) needed for producing the copies 
cost $2.50 a gallon; a gallon is sufficient to moisten 
15,000 sheets of copy paper. 

There are three grades of carbon to suit different 
lenghts and sharpness of run. No.3 carbon from 1 to 75 
copies. No.3-M up to 200 copies, and No.H-2 for 200 copies 
and over. These carbons are all priced the same.
