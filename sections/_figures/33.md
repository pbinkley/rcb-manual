This photo-offset page is made up in a format that costs 
the same to reproduce as an economical print format. The 
$365.00 that would be required to print 50,000 words is here 
devoted to making a photo-offset reproduction from typescript. 
$62.50 of it is allotted to the composition cost, leaving 
$302.50 to pay for the running costs. This amount will buy 
500 copies of sixty-nine pages, 93″ x 12″, or, as with this 
format, 138 pages, 6″ x 9½″. With the larger size page, only 
725 words need be put on each page; with this 6″ x 9½″ page, 
only 363 words need be put on each page. 

Leaving wide margins and typing in a single column with 
four-lines-to-the-inch spacing, a reduction of 33% takes care 
of the word content. The resulting page is a very legible 
and very expensive way of putting the photo-offset process 
into use. 

If it should happen that the format copy were then sent 
to a photo-offset printer for quotation who was using a press 
with a 17″ x 22″ metal sheet, his quotation for the job would 
be substantially higher than the figure of $302.50 that is 
the basis of this calculation, because he would have to run 
the whole printing surface to get four pages of 6″ x 9½″, 
and the wastage of his metal sheet printing surface would be 
almost 40%. This fact is brought into the picture to emphasize the importance of considering, in the planning of a format, not only the arrangement of typescript columns that will 
lay the required number of words on a page, but also the relation of the page size chosen to the dimensions of the metal 
sheet of the press upon which it is to be run.
