> {% include pagebreak.html canvas=219 %}This chapter has been subjected to criticism by the Bureau of 
Standards, and the Permanence and Durability Committee of the Technical Association of the Pulp and Paper Industry. 
    The latter body contested certain conclusions of the paper as originally submitted 
    and has expressed a wish that the chapter be published as amended by then, 
    if it is to be published with their approval. Comments and controversial material, therefore, which had been written in the original draft of this chapter and revised out of it, have sometimes been 
    inserted here as footnotes; the substance of the chapter as it stands 
    without the footnotes has been issued separately as a report of the 
    Technical Association of the Pulp and Paper Industry. 
  

{% include columnbreak.html canvas=219 col=1 %}The outstanding qualities required 
of a book paper are four: printing surface, opacity, strength, and permanence 
and durability. Other qualities of a greater or lesser importance are color, feel, 
formation, aesthetic value, etc., depending on the purpose for which the paper is 
to be used. The printability, opacity, and 
strength qualities of book paper can be determined by suitable testing instruments 
and expressed in numerical terms. The 
fourth outstanding quality, namely, permanence and durability, is not as easily expressed. Permanence of a paper has been 
defined as the degree of resistance towards 
the degrading chemical action of the impurities in the paper or of materials in the 
surrounding air. Durability is the degree 
to which the paper retains its original 
qualities under usage. In a 1933 report 
from the Bureau of Standards,[^n1] it was 
brought out that important factors in the 
permanence and durability of book papers 
are the chemical purity of the fibers in
the sheet, and the conditions under which 
the books are kept. Paper from books 
stored in urban institutions is uniformly 
more deteriorated than that from identical 
volumes kept in rural libraries, according 
to the Bureau of Standards investigation. 
The much thumbed-over books in the children's department of the public library {% include columnbreak.html canvas=219 col=2 %} show the results of wear in use, but there 
is little doubt that the lasting quality of 
paper is not only dependent upon its environment but is partly related to the paper itself. This permanence quality, however, is not immediately apparent to the 
observer. The only absolute test of permanence and durability would require that one 
should wait to see what happens to the paper in the course of several centuries or 
until there is positive evidence of deterioration. 

[^n1]: Arthur E. Kimberly, and Adelaide L. Emley, "A Study of the Deterioriation of Book Papers in Libraries," *Bureau of Standards Miscellaneous Publications*, No. 140. 

In the days when paper was an innovation in Europe, competing with parchment, it was regarded as dangerously impermanent, and there was legislation to prohibit its use in legal documents. Of the books printed in the earlier centuries, enough have endured the effect of time to establish beyond question the permanence possibilities in papers made of the materials then in use. During the period 1875--1910, unpurified or crude fibers, such as 
ground wood, were frequently used in book 
papers. The Bureau of Standards, in its 
report, to which reference has already been 
made, found that book papers containing appreciable quantities of crude fibers were 
invariably in poorer condition than those 
containing rag and chemical wood fibers. 
The period 1875-1910, therefore, is defined 
as one in which the paper in books published {% include pagebreak.html canvas=220 %} in this period may be quite impermanent. 
This served to emphasize the importance of 
the chemical purity of the fibers themselves as a factor in the permanence of paper. At the beginning of the present century, paper technicians were calling attention to the danger of printing on paper 
containing crude fibers, such as ground 
wood pulp. The conclusion was drawn at 
that time that papers had a life expectancy proportionate to the amount of rag stock 
used in their manufacture.[^n2]

[^n2]: Despite the fact that the very oldest paper of all---the early Chinese---seems to have been made from grass fibers. 

The distributing trade had little 
knowledge concerning the problem of paper 
permanence and durability. The market 
designations of paper ordinarily in use include size, weight, color, surface finish, 
and a description of the raw materials from 
which the paper is made. The raw material 
may be described with varying degrees of 
precision. The simplest distinction is 
that which runs between "rag" and "wood 
pulp" papers, and those which contain different proportions of both. The rags, however, are not of equal quality. The hardest and most durable fibers are the new unbleached cotton trimmings which are bleached 
in the paper mill. Then come the scraps 
left from the manufacture of overalls, "new 
blues;" then the white rags from wornout 
clothing from the housewife's rag bag;[^n3] and, 
finally, soiled rags of different colors 
from different sources.[^n4] The higher classes of rags require less chemical treatment 
for paper stock and, therefore, yield a more 
permanent paper when carefully manufactured. The lower classes of rags usually 
undergo a more drastic chemical treatment 
before being converted to paper and do not 
yield as strong or as permanent a paper, 
although for many purposes it may possess 
other more desirable properties.[^n5] The wood 
used in paper making is also subject to 
various classifications: there is the distinction between the soft (coniferous) 
woods and the hard (deciduous) woods. Then 
there are different processes by which the 
wood is converted into pulp to receive consideration. First, there is the important 
distinction between "mechanical wood pulp" {% include columnbreak.html canvas=220 col=2 %} (groundwood) and "chemical wood pulp." 
Newsprint paper, for instance, is chiefly 
mechanical wood pulp; most book paper is 
made of chemical wood pulp. By different 
kinds of chemical treatment the impurities 
in the wood are removed and a fiber of relatively high purity, compared to a mechanical wood pulp fiber, is obtained. "Soda 
pulp" is made by digesting wood chips in 
an alkaline solution, such as sodium hydroxide, and is composed of fibers from 
hard woods. "Sulphite pulp," on the other 
hand, is made chiefly from soft woods by 
digesting the wood chips in a solution of 
sulfurous acid and calcium bisulphite. The 
fibers generally possess different properties compared to those made by the soda 
process owing to their difference of origin. Recently certain additional processes 
giving further purification to chemical 
wood pulps have appeared.

[^n4]: "No. 2 old rags." 

[^n5]: A paper made directly from raw cotton was being developed in 1934 by one paper company in America. Ramie grass fibers are proposed as another paper-making material, but the writer knows of no firm actually using them. 

Within the past decade or so; some 
paper users have become dissatisfied with 
the more or less crude paper specifications 
and have begun to introduce laboratory procedures in standardizing their paper purchases. The distributing trade has not 
followed this line of development, however; 
its interests have been heavily vested in 
the existing trade practices. Recently 
some of the larger users of papers, who 
could establish direct contact with the 
manufacturers, began to demand and to receive "specification papers." It is reported that about 1% of the finer paper 
trade in 1928 was on a laboratory specification basis, and that by 1933 this had risen
to 10%. 

The specifications which were most 
successfully established were those relating to the physical strength qualities of ' 
the paper. Standard physical tests were 
tearing resistance, bursting strength, tensile strength, and folding endurance. For nearly ten years government specifications 
for permanent all-rag content papers have 
carried requirements as to the grade of new 
rag permitted. In addition, limits as to 
rosin size and acidity have also been included. Specifications relating to {% include pagebreak.html canvas=221 %} probable longevity of a paper were not so 
easily set up but progress is being made in 
that direction. 

The librarians seem to have been 
the ones who showed the first and greatest 
desire for permanence in book papers, but 
they were in a bad strategic position for 
making their desires effective. They were 
many times removed from the paper manufacturers; they had little influence on the 
publishers and none on the paper distributors. The British Library Association set 
up a committee which drew up some permanence specifications for paper. In general, 
however, the paper trade continued to sell 
its goods as "100% rag," "50% rag," or 
"Sulphite" and induced the buyer to believe 
that the more he paid, the greater was the 
probable longevity of the paper. 

When the laboratory men began to 
work on paper specifications, not only was 
the source of the fiber studied but its 
chemical and physical qualities were examined. The most important material comprising the fibers used in papermaking is 
the organic substance known as *cellulose*, 
the cell wall of the plant, and its chemical properties are essentially the same whether it is found in the cottonseed hair, 
cornstalks, or trees, whether it goes to 
the paper mill as a discarded shirt or a 
spruce log. In all papers cellulose is the 
basic ingredient, although there is a big 
difference in the structure of different 
fibers and this is an important characteristic in papermaking. Furthermore, associated with cellulose in the crude or unpurified fiber, there are often undesirable substances, called impurities, which are removed by chemical treatment as already indicated. These impurities vary in nature 
and in amount, depending on the source of 
the fiber. Ordinary pulp wood is composed 
of over 50% cellulosic material and "impurities" to the extent of about 30%. When 
newsprint paper is made by grinding logs 
into mechanical wood pulp, all the "impurities" or undesirable substances go into 
the paper. Raw cotton, on the other hand, 
represents a fiber containing about 90% 
cellulose and a minimum of "impurities." 

{% include columnbreak.html canvas=221 col=2 %} Tests which are often used to determine the purity and quality of the fibers composing a paper are: acidity, sizing, alpha cellulose, and copper number. In 
general, there is agreement among paper 
technologists that the acidity and the rosin sizing should be kept low for a permanent paper. The alpha cellulose content of 
a paper refers to that portion of the cellulose which is not soluble in a solution of 
sodium hydroxide under certain defined conditions.[^n6] These are entirely empirical conditions however. The alkali-resistant or 
alpha cellulose content of the cellulose 
portion of a paper is presumably proportionate to the fiber purity, a high percentage 
alpha cellulose value being desirable for a 
permanent paper. The copper number is also 
indicative of fiber purity, the higher the 
number the greater the degree of damage to 
the fibers. Other tests which have been 
used in specifying book papers for permanent records are: ash, folding endurance, 
bursting strength, opacity, weight, and 
thickness. No single test can be considered at the present time as an adequate 
criterion of paper permanency. Even the 
lists of tests, mentioned above, yield a 
not too satisfactory picture of the probable life expectancy of a paper as far as 
purity of the sheet is concerned. Other 
tests which may become more reliable indices of paper permanence are now in the 
process of development. 

[^n6]: Alpha cellulose can be separated from its bad relatives, beta and gamma cellulose, by giving the fibers a bath in caustic soda. Some of the cellulose of the fibers will be dissolved into a liquid. Some of the liquid can then be jellied---this is beta cellulose. Some of the liquid refuses to jell---this is gamma cellulose. But the pure, strong cellulose resists the action of the caustic soda. It is alpha cellulose, the white hope of paper chemistry. 

Paper manufactured from the highest 
grade of cotton rags receives the minimum 
of treatment. The raw material itself is 
of a very high degree of purity and, carefully processed, yields from known experience a paper of very great permanence and 
durability. Such papers possess an alpha 
cellulose content well over 90% and « copper number considerably less than 1.0. Lower grade rags and chemical wood pulps require more severe treatment in their isolation or purification before being converted 
to paper. Ordinary processes of making 
chemical wood pulp do not yield a product 
with 90% alpha cellulose content. Purification processes are now available, however, whereby the alpha cellulose content {% include pagebreak.html canvas=222 %} of such pulps, referred to as "alpha pulps,"
approaches that of the better grades of cotton rags.[^n7]

[^n7]: The Brown Company, pulp manufacturers of Berlin, New Hampshire, have developed some of these refining processes and have put their highly purified pulp on the market as "solka fiber." Paper chemists are not certain as to how far such highly purified wood pulps can displace rag fibers as an ingredient for permanent papers. The Brown Company sponsored a study of this problem at the Bureau of Standards. 

When purified, chemical wood pulps 
have proven very satisfactory for certain 
papers and as a substitute for certain 
grades of rags. With our increasing knowledge of paper, its raw materials and manufacture, the future may provide a more permanent paper made from a greater variety of 
materials. 

## Proposed Classification and Specifications for Permanent Book Papers 

### (1) Classification of Book Papers Relative to Their Permanence Qualities[^n8]

[^n8]: Taken from John O. Burton, "Permanence Studies of Commercial Book Paper," *Bureau of Standards Journal of Research*, 7, 437-9 (1931). 

A system of classification of 
printing and writing papers relative to 
their permanence qualities has been suggested by the United States Bureau of Standards.[^n9] Mr. B. W. Scribner, of the Bureau 
of Standards, proposed that the ingredients 
to be specified be a percentage of alpha 
cellulose, and he suggested, as an additional innovation, an accelerated aging test 
om "Stability" specification. Underlying 
this test is the assumption that paper deterioration is a chemical action which can 
be accelerated by the influence of heat. 
Paper samples of known alpha cellulose content, chemical purity, and physical strength 
are subjected to oven heat for seventy-two 
hours at 100° C., and then tested for loss 
of chemical and physical qualities. The 
loss is expressed as a percentage. This 
classification is based upon the purity and 
strength of the finished paper. The values 
given are derived from the results of the 
extensive investigations of the Bureau during the past four years into the permanence 
of paper. In these investigations, tests 
similar to the ones described here have 
been made on a large number and variety of 
papers, and it is believed that papers ful{% include columnbreak.html canvas=222 col=2 %}filling the requirements of the various 
groups will have the relative degrees 
permanence indicated.[^n10]

[^n9]: B. W. Scribner, "Permanence Standards for Printing and Writing Papers," LII, 19, pp. 52-5 (May-August, 1930); also *Paper Mill*, LIII, p. 13, June 21, 1930. 

[^n10]: The full text of the Scribner-Burton specifications is in the Appendix at the end of this Chapter. 

In this system of classification, 
all papers are divided into four classes. 
The first class contains those papers which 
may be expected to have maximum longevity. 
A book paper fulfilling the requirements of 
this class would be particularly suitable 
for bound volumes of records having permanent value. The second class contains papers of high purity. Papers used for semi-permanent records and in fine editions of 
rare and costly books should fulfill the 
requirements of this class. The third class 
is composed of papers which, while not having as high a degree of purity as those in 
the first two classes, have a fair degree 
of purity. Such papers could be used where 
moderate longevity is desired, such as in 
reference periodicals. Papers in the fourth 
class are those suitable for current use 
only.[^n11] Table XXXIV, on the following 
pages, illustrates in detail how such a system of classification might be applied to 
book papers. 

[^n11]: It should be noted here that an additional "stability" specification is included for Class I papers: that alpha cellulose content should not decrease more than 1.5%, folding endurance more than 25%, and copper number should not increase more than .05%,after the paper is heated 72 hours at 100° C. 

### (2) Specifications of the Joint Committee on Printing U. S. Government.[^n12] 

[^n12]: Issue of December 8, 1932, p. 15. Government specifications for permanent papers antedate all other similar specifications in this country by several years. 

The paper must be made with every 
precaution to insure the maximum serviceability and permanency. Care must be taken 
to use the minimum quantities of bleach, 
rosin, size, and alum. The finished paper 
must not show the presence of any injurious 
residual chemicals which will interfere in 
any way with the permanency of color or 
the serviceability and durability of the 
paper. {% include pagebreak.html canvas=223 %}

## The Paper Trade and the Proposed Specifications 

The interest of the paper trade in 
specifications is recent and welcome. Technical knowledge is far ahead of the market 
conditions. Some of the conclusions of paper technologists are in satisfactory agreement and can be used safely as a guide by 
publishers in search of permanent paper. 
However, on entering the market to buy paper, the publisher discovers that the distributing trade is not accustomed to the 
use of even the minimum specifications upon 
which there is agreement. 

The Rag Paper Division of the Writing Paper Manufacturers! Association has 
suggested tentatively some specifications, 
which are set forth in a comparative table 
at the end of this chapter; but for a final 
judgment on permanence specifications, it
awaits the conclusion of the experimental 
work in progress. 

A test made at the Bureau of Standards confirms the fact that a purchaser who 
merely specifies a percentage of rag content in a book paper has no assurance that 
he is paying for permanence quality. Thus 
is the importance of careful specifications 
brought out. 

{% include columnbreak.html canvas=225 col=2 %} A list of the book papers investigated by John Burton[^n13] is herewith tabulated (Table XXXV, on the following page) with the proposed permanence classification indicated in each case. This is based on 
chemical and physical tests on the papers. 
For this proposed classification, see an 
earlier portion of this chapter.[^n14] According to this classification system only one 
of the twenty-eight papers studied could 
qualify as a permanent and durable paper, 
but several were only slightly deficient. 
The importance of careful processing of fibers was emphatically brought out as a result of this investigation. A fiber of 
initial high quality may have its purity 
seriously lowered by improper processing, 
and fibers of much lower original purity 
may be purified to a high degree by proper 
treatment. 

[^n13]: John O. Burton, "Permanence Studies of Current Commercial Book Papers," *Bureau of Standards Journal of Research*, VII (1931), 429-39. 

[^n14]: These tests were made in 1920; the manufacturers since that time have probably improved their products. But some advertising is still misleading. The writer has seen advertising matter which proposed the following absurd specifications: 50 to 100 years, 100% rag; 35 to 50 years, 75% rag; 15 to 35 years, 50% rag; 5 to 15 years, 25% rag; 3 to 5 years, sulphite. 

These data serve to bring out the 
importance of careful specifications in the 
matter of permanent and durable book papers, no single test or specifications being adequate. 

## Conclusions for the Paper Buyer 

It is easy to understand why ordinary market book papers, whether of rag, {% include pagebreak.html canvas=226 %}

{% include pagebreak.html canvas=227 %} chemical wood pulp, or mixture, should not 
be permanent papers; and emphasis has been 
on beauty and printability rather than on 
permanence and durability. Paper technologists have the formulae for papers which 
would satisfy the demand for permanence but 
such a demand has not been large enough to 
control market practices. The lack of 
agreement over specifications has made it 
difficult for the buyers who want permanence to exert their full weight in the 
market, and the small buyer can have little influence even if he knows what he 
wants unless he happens to want a stock 
commodity. 

A number of specifications are included in an appended chart which gives, in 
addition, the properties and approximate 
prices of certain all-rag or purified chemical wood pulp papers, actually or potentially available. 

How are these specifications to be 
interpreted? The paper technologists quickly draw the layman beyond his depth in the 
discussion, but a few facts stand out as 
agreed or uncontested, and upon these the 
publisher may safely base his policy. 

### (1) Fiber Content of Highest Class Papers 

It is always insufficient to specify merely a source of the fibers, as, for 
instance, "rag" or "50% rag." Now only 
should the quality of the fiber be specified but specifications covering the manufactured paper should be carefully drawn. 
These should include ash content, acidity, 
rosin sizing, alpha cellulose, copper number, folding endurance, bursting strength, 
and perhaps other tests depending on the 
use requirements of the sheet. No one or 
two tests alone, any more than the source 
of the fiber, can entirely define the permanence of a paper. 
For instance, some of 
the new fillers now being used in book papers will give a high false copper number 
without any other indication of impermanence. Others believe that a low alpha 
cellulose of rags which have been properly 
purified is not an index of impermanence. 
It is natural that the more information we 
have concerning the properties of a paper, 
the more can we judge of its general quality and usability for the purposes we have 
in mind. 

Although it is admitted that there {% include columnbreak.html canvas=227 col=2 %} is no general agreement on the specifications necessary for a permanent paper made 
from fibers other than the highest grade of 
rags, the dealers and even the buying public in general have been slow to realize 
the need for and the significance of a permanent book paper. When the buyers specify 
these superior properties in a paper, the 
manufacturers will quote prices consistent 
with the specifications and the desired 
product will be delivered. It lies with 
the buying public to assist the manufacturers to keep pace with the findings of the 
paper technologists. 

### (2) Fiber Content of Second-Class Papers 

Price becomes a leading consideration among the less permanent papers, and 
specifications do not have to be as rigid 
as with the first-class papers. Thus, in 
the Burton classification for book papers 
of high purity for semi-permanent records, 
the chemical and physical constants are ex- 
tended considerably beyond those for book 
papers of maximum purity for permanent records. The buyer should test and carefully 
check to specifications all papers before 
use in order to be sure he is getting his 
full money value. Again, no single test 
should be used as a criterion of the permanence quality of the paper under consideration. 

### (3) Ground or Mechanical Wood Pulp 

No groundwood or mechanical wood 
pulp should be present in any paper designed for anything more than temporary use. 

### (4) Acidity 

It is undisputed that high acidity 
causes rapid deterioration of paper. Acidity is measured in two ways: the acid number is determined by volumetric analysis 
and indicates the amount of acid present, 
while the pH value is a measure of the hydrogen-ion concentration or strength of the 
acid. A paper testing pH 4.5, for instance, 
is about 30 times more acid than one testing pH 6 and is more likely to become degraded on this account. 

### (5) Sizing Material 

The presence of large amounts of 
rosin as a sizing material in paper is likely to bring about a discoloration or yellowing in papers on aging. There is general {% include pagebreak.html canvas=228 %} agreement that the rosin content of permanent papers should be kept low, probably 
below 1%. 

### (6) Fillers or Loading Materials 

There is not complete agreement as 
to the significance of mineral fillers for 
permanent and durable papers. Too much material will probably reduce the durability 
of the sheet, but a small amount of the 
proper filler does no harm in the opinion 
of many paper technologists. 


## The Influence of Price 

The paper buyer can be sure that 
any of these permanence specifications are 
better than none; they emphasize different 
elements of the paper, but they all agree 
in guiding the purchaser away from papers 
which have been manufactured (as many book 
papers are manufactured) without taking 
into account any permanence requirements 
whatsoever. 

The publisher who is using small 
quantities of paper stands two steps removed from the manufacturers. The trade is 
organized to distribute paper from manufacturer to jobber or dealer and from there to 
printer. In some cases the manufacturing 
process is divided, one firm making the 
pulp and another the paper. Since the qualities which give a paper its permanence are 
due in large measure to the manufacture and 
processing of the pulp, it is especially 
desirable that the buyer should make a special effort to secure paper conforming to 
permanence specifications. 

If he enters the market with some 
permanence specifications he will probably 
find his printer, and the printer's jobber, 
unequipped with any tested papers. He may 
have to work his way back to the manufacturer. He will find that paper is sold 
normally in 500-pound cases, but that manufacturers will often make a special run of 
paper for an order as small as 1 ton (4 
cases). The manufacturing and selling units 
are case, ton and carload (15-18 tons). The 
trade is familiar with the practice by 
which price drops as the size of the order 
increases to the carload; these price variations are of use in interpreting comparative pricing of paper, but of the greatest 
importance because they constitute an index of the size of order which will have 
sufficient importance to induce a manufac{% include columnbreak.html canvas=228 col=2 %}turer to conform to permanence specifications. 

The Joint Committee on Materials 
for Research has found some firms willing 
to have their paper quoted in terms of a 
price index. If "normal," i.e., low-cost 
book paper is $.08 a pound, then these papers would be sold at the prices listed in 
the table. The Rag Paper Division of the 
Writing Paper Manufacturers! Association 
advises that if the base price is $.08, the 
price of a permanent paper meeting their 
specifications should be $.32. The prices 
named in connection with Government Printing Office specifications are those actually bid in 1932. It must be observed that 
this relationship in prices prevails: the 
"offset book" paper (not for permanent use) 
was bought at less than $.04, and the "permanent record book" paper at over $.16. It 
is evident, therefore, that large quantity 
orders and competitive bidding can reduce 
prices greatly, but the ratio between 
prices of papers of different qualities is 
not radically changed. 

Under normal trade conditions the 
trade mark-ups and discounts should permit 
price variations in the following scale: 
(A paper selling at $.05 a pound, i.e., 
$10.00 a case in 2 1/2 ton lots). 

Price from Manufacturer to Distributor 

Price per Case in Lots of: 

| 1 case | 1 ton (4 cases) | 2½ tons | 5 tons | 18 tons (carloads) |
| $11.00 | $10.50 | $10.00 | $9.70 | $9.50 | 

The distributor's mark-up would range from 
$1.60 in the one-case lots to an extreme 
low of $.50 to $.95 in carload lots. The 
printer's mark-up should be anything from 
10% to 25% of what he pays the dealer. 
These mark-ups do not constitute an excessive charge for the distributing service 
offered, nor do they greatly increase publishing cost.

How does paper cost figure into ' 
book cost? Paper is sold by the pound; a
standard size of sheet is 25" x 38"; the 
weight of the paper is usually given as 
that of 500 sheets, 25" x 38". Since a 
sheet of this paper will print 24 pages, 
8" x 9 1/2", a ream will supply paper for {% include pagebreak.html canvas=229 %} 38 copies. Paper weighing 45 pounds to the 
ream---a good stout book paper weight, as 
the paper samples indicate---will make up a 
300-page book weighing a little over one 
pound. The difference between the highest 
and the lowest paper prices would not come 
to more than $.30 a volume, or less than 
10% of the cost of an edition of 300. If 
the edition is small, the use of the most 
expensive paper need not greatly increase 
the price of the book, but may greatly increase its utility. 

But most book manufacturing---practically all commercial book manufacturing---calls for larger editions, in which the 
composition and press charge is distributed 
over more copies, and the paper cost therefore proportionately higher. Moreover, the 
economics of the publishing business require that each book shall be printed in an 
edition larger than that for which there is 
immediate and certain sale. The chance of 
selling some of the overprint affords the 
prospect of profit. But the storage of unsold volumes increases the paper cost which 
must be borne by the volumes actually sold. 
If in an edition of 1000 books, weighing 
one pound each, the cost of paper is increased $.07 a pound (from $.07 to $.14) 
the increased cost levied upon the purchaser need not be more than $.07 a volume if 
the whole edition is sold; but if only 250 
copies are sold, the ratable portion of the 
added paper cost which each must bear rises 
to $.28. It is the storage of valuable paper in unsold books that makes it so costly to use high-priced paper in commercial 
publishing. And therefore, two policies 
open out before those who would improve the 
lasting quality of books. 

The first is the policy followed by 
the New York *Times*: publication in two editions; one a small edition, for relatively 
certain sale, printed on expensive rag paper of high durability and permanence; the 
other an edition for temporary consumption. 
But the publishers assert that in commercial publishing such a policy would introduce many new costs, not only on the press, 
but in storing and filling orders. The 
American Library Association favors the application of this policy to government documents.[^n15] 

[^n15]: The University of California Press applies it to scientific publications, printing 25 copies on a rag stock conforming to U. S. Government Printing Office specifications for highest permanence (see chart). 

{% include columnbreak.html canvas=229 col=2 %} The second policy is that which 
will be practicable as rag, purified chemical wood pulp or other papers at moderate 
prices prove to have satisfactory lasting 
qualities. The permanence level of all 
book papers can be raised, without greatly 
increasing prices. A basic economic argument helps at this point. The carefully 
manufactured rag papers with alpha cellulose content up to 97% can be manufactured 
to be more durable than a paper that merely passes the proposed Burton Class I tests. 
But it cannot be widely used in the publishing industry because of cost; its usefulness will lie in the small editions which 
do not threaten to leave their makers with 
a great bulk of expensive paper unsold on 
the shelves. The improvement of permanence 
qualities in the normal product of the publishing trade must depend upon the development of less expensive papers. The buyer 
must be induced to demand what the technicians are able to make, a rag or purified 
chemical wood pulp paper manufactured for 
permanence, and sold at a moderate price. 

## Preservation of Old Newsprint Paper 

Whatever improvement in standards of 
manufacture and choice of paper may be anticipated, it cannot affect the fifty 
years' legacy of inferior paper that has 
already been used and that now stands on 
our library shelves in imminent peril of 
dissolution. Newsprint paper is especially 
vulnerable. Can it be saved? 

The Bureau of Standards reached a 
certain point in devising a method of pressing sheets of cellulose acetate into the 
newsprint fiber in such a way that the air 
was excluded and tremendous folding endurance developed. This process required no 
adhesives. The New York Public Library 
protects some of its newspaper files by 
covering both sides of the sheets with Japanese tissue paper, then smoothing them by 
running them through a heated mangle. This 
process has been used by the New York Public Library since 1916. Legibility is decreased somewhat, but the library feels 
that its experience indicates that this disadvantage is offset by the increased 
strength and lengthened span of life of the 
paper. The cost of this process is {% include pagebreak.html canvas=230 %} approximately $.08 a sheet, or $.04 a page. 
emis of the New York Public Library 
product is bound herewith. Dr. Joseph 
Broadman of New York City has developed a 
similar plan for pasting a protective transparent layer over each newsprint surface. 

It is possible that the preservation of the newspaper records will not be 
feasible by way of the preservation of the 
paper, and it may be that the files printed on the most impermanent stock can be 
preserved only by film-copying them and letting the originals disappear. This problem will be discussed in Chapter XI in connection with the cost levels of microcopying on film. The question has already received some attention in Chapter III as a 
special case of reprinting material by 
photo-offset. 

## APPENDIX 

The following material was not approved by the Technical Association of the Pulp and Paper Industry, but is printed herewith, not as a part of the discussion carried above, but as supplementary information offered subject to the layman's qualms as to its accuracy. 

The Scribner-Burton specifications 
are as follows: 

### EXCERPT FROM PAPER BY B. W. SCRIBNER, BUREAU OF STANDARDS, ON PERMANENCE STANDARDS FOR PAPER 

> In consideration of both usage 
    of papers and the grades of papers 
    available, it is suggested that they 
    might be classified in four main 
    groups according to their degree of 
    cellulose and non-cellulose purity, 
    as related to their service requirements. According to such mode of 
    classification, the present domestic 
    printing and writing papers may be 
    grouped as follows: 
  
> *Grade I*. Permanent papers, having a 
    maximum degree of purity; free from 
    unbleached fibers, and highly lignified fibers such as groundwood. Indicative chemical properties: alpha 
    cellulose, 90%; copper number, 1.5; 
    rosin, 1%; acidity, 5 pH; changes on {% include columnbreak.html canvas=230 col=2 %} heating 72 hours 
    in content of alpha-cellulose should 
    be not more than 1.5%, decrease in 
    folding endurance not more than 25%, 
    increase in copper number not more 
    than 0.5. 
  
> *Grade II*. Papers quite highly purified that may be expected to have a 
    minimum life of 100 years; free from 
    unbleached fibers, and highly lignified fibers such as groundwood. Indicative chemical properties: alpha 
    cellulose, 80%; copper number, 2.5; 
    rosin, 165%; acidity, 5 pH. 
  
> *Grade III*. Papers having a fair degree of purity that may be expected 
    to have a minimum life of 50 years; 
    free from unbleached fibers and highly lignified fibers such as groundwood. Indicative chemical properties: alpha cellulose, 70%; copper 
    number, 53; rosin, 2%; acidity, 5 pH. 
  
> *Grade IV*. Papers having a low degree 
    of purity containing considerable organic impurities, suitable for current use only. This grade includes 
    papers containing unbleached fibers, 
    and highly lignified fibers such as 
    groundwood. 
  
> All figures for chemical components in these grade descriptions 
    are upper limits, except for alpha 
    cellulose contents which are lower 
    limits. Alpha cellulose content and 
    copper number are based on total cellulose content. 
  
> As stated in these grade descriptions, the purity limits are 
    given merely as indicative and are 
    not suggested as specification requirements, for the fixing of specification details must necessarily be 
    done by the consumers and manufacturers directly concerned. In each of 
    these grades, the establishment of 
    two or more strength requirements for 
    each weight of paper is necessary. 
    Also, as less strength is required in 
    book papers than in writing papers, 
    different strength ranges are necessary for these two classes of paper. 
    The strength requirements, of course, 

{% include enclosure.html incl="08-106" %}

> {% include pagebreak.html canvas=233 %} must be fixed with consideration of 
    the kind and extent of mechanical 
    stresses to which the paper will be 
    subjected in its use. The strength 
    gradations of the government papers 
    should be of particular assistance in 
    this respect, although as they refer 
    to a testing condition of 50% relative humidity, they should be modified for commercial use to accord with 
    the standard commercial testing condition of 65% relative humidity. 
  
<hr/>

> These specifications led the 
    Joint Committee to interests itself 
    in the possibility of utilizing a
    purified wood-pulp fiber in lieu of 
    rag fiber where permanence is desired. 
    In an effort to make a practical demonstration of the possible use of a 
    wood-pulp paper manufactured for permanence, the Joint Committee received 
    the cooperation of Dill and Collins, 
    Paper Manufacturers of Philadelphia, 
    and Scribners, publishers of the *Dictionary of American Biography*. Dill 
    and Collins manufactured a sample lot 
    of highly purified wood-pulp paper. 
    This paper was used for one-third of 
    the pages of 25 copies of Volume XIII 
    of the *Dictionary*. An all-rag paper 
    of high alpha cellulose content was 
    purchased from the Worthy Paper Company for another third of the pages. 
    The remaining third were printed on 
    the paper supplied by the American 
    Writing Company. 

> The alpha cellulose and copper number and accelerated aging test {% include columnbreak.html canvas=233 col=2 %} of these three papers are shown in the table below. 

SPECIFICATIONS FOR A WOOD-PULP FIBER PAPER 

| Concern | Alpha Cellulose | Copper Number |Loss of Folding Endurance under Accelerated Aging Test | Alpha Content After Aging |

> To the publisher all this complexity is reduced to two simple questions: what price shall he pay for 
    book paper, and what weight shall he 
    give to the rag—content specification as against other specifications, 
    such as those stated in terms of alpha cellulose content? 
    
> Let it be supposed then that 
    the evidence is clear and undisputed 
    that high price alone, and rag-content specifications alone, offer no 
    guarantee of permanence, and even 
    though the technician soon draws the 
    layman beyond his depth in the discussion of specifications, a few 
    facts stand out as agreed or uncontested. 

> 1. A paper meeting the Scribner-Burton specifications for maximum permanence, with a life probability greater than that of most of the 
    all-rag book papers on the market, 
    can be made without rags, from purified wood fibers. 

> 2. A paper capable of surviving more severe tests than those proposed by Scribner, with a life probability greater than that of the best 
    purified wood-pulp paper, can be made 
    of new muslin cuttings. 

> 3. The adoption and enforcement of specifications calling for 
    either of the two papers described 
    above would constitute an immense 
    improvement over current practices. 

> The difference in permanence 
    between paper meeting Scribner specifications and paper surpassing those {% include columnbreak.html canvas=380 col=2 %} specifications is an unknown quantity; 
    a definite estimate of the price difference can be made: if permanent 
    purified wood-pulp papers cost $.10 to 
    $.15 a pound, then the special permanent rag papers should cost from $.16 
    to $.35 a pound.

> Correspondence with a number 
    of paper manufacturers has yielded 
    the information tabulated as to papers 
    now available on the market. The results of the tests are as given by the 
    manufacturers themselves; they have 
    not been checked. 

> Because other paper manufacturers may wish to offer papers meeting these specifications, the writer 
    has asked the Rag Paper Manufacturers' 
    Association, Springfield, Massachusetts, and the American Pulp and Paper Association, New York City, to 
    receive the names of manufacturers who 
    may wish to offer products conforming 
    to these specifications, and transmit 
    them to prospective paper purchasers 
    upon request. 

> The following firms are among 
    those which will test papers to cover 
    all the particulars of the specifications tabulated: 

> New York Testing Laboratories   
    80th Street and East Avenue, New York City 

> Arthur D. Little   
    Charles River Road, Cambridge, Massachusetts 

> Skinner and Sherman, Inc.   
    276 Sherman Street, Boston, Massachusetts 

> United States Testing Company   
    1415 Park Avenue, Hoboken, New Jersey

> ## Bond Papers and Onionskin 

> Another field in which permanence is of great importance is that 
    of bond papers, used for typescript 
    correspondence and records of the 
    archival type, and also in connection 
    with the various near-print methods 
    of reproducing text, such as mimeograph and hectograph. The general 
    business practice of the country calls {% include pagebreak.html canvas=235 %} for a more permanent stock of paper 
    for letters than for books, and a 
    less permanent stock for carbon copies than for books. The average business letter sheet will last longer 
    than the average book page; the average carbon copy will fall to pieces 
    sooner. 

> As the problems of archive 
    administration in business become better understood, it will no doubt become apparent that the carbon copies 
    of certain classes of correspondence 
    require more permanence qualities 
    than the originals themselves, since 
    they constitute the firm's records of 
    its own commitments. The greater part 
    of business correspondence is systematically destroyed after a period of 
    a few years, but for those classes of 
    business correspondence that are intended for permanent preservation, it 
    is appropriate to insist upon paper 
    specifications comparable to those 
    used for permanent record books. Onionskin papers of rag content are available, and the Eaton Paper Company has 
    developed a line of purified wood-pulp 
    onionskin paper. Some of their literature credits this line with 93% alpha cellulose. Test data supplied by 
    the Brightwater Paper Company on the 
    same or a similar line shows alpha 
    cellulose content of 88.25, copper 
    number 1.68, and loss of folding endurance in accelerated aging, 37%. The 
    writer has not explored the bond paper 
    field except in a haphazard way, but 
    believes that in the main the technological considerations governing permanence are the same for bond as for 
    book papers, and that the argument for 
    using chemical and performance specifications is as good in the one case 
    as in the other. {% include columnbreak.html canvas=235 col=2 %}

> ## Beauty and Legibility in Papers 

> The analysis of the paper 
    situation from the standpoint of permanence has not taken into account the 
    paper quality upon which the buyers 
    of paper are most insistent, namely, 
    beauty. The importance of an attractive paper in scholarly publishing is 
    not alone its artistic contribution 
    to the quality of a finished book, but 
    also its relation to legibility. It 
    has been demonstrated repeatedly that 
    the legibility or attractiveness of a 
    printed text is the product of many 
    variables, such as size of type, format of page, and use of print face as 
    against typescript letters. It is 
    clear that paper quality also enters 
    into legibility as an important variable. It seems quite probable that 
    the product of the hectograph, with 
    its light purple ink, could be made 
    more legible and attractive if run on 
    a yellow-ivory paper. A reader choosing between typescript and print face 
    on a book page would have his choice 
    materially affected if the print face 
    should be offered on an unattractive 
    paper, the typescript on a beautiful 
    one. And here again a fundamental 
    rule of small edition publishing must 
    be respected: that because the paper 
    cost is so small a part of the total
    cost, an economical place to seek for
    quality in the product is by using 
    the highest class of paper. {% include pagebreak.html canvas=236 %}
