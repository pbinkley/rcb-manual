## Van Dyke and Lithoprint (First Costs High; Running Costs Low) 

{% include pagebreak.html canvas=155 %} A number of techniques have been 
developed for the copying of architects' 
drawings, maps, and other non-textual material, but adapted to certain problems in 
the reproduction of texts. In these copying techniques it is a question of decisive 
importance whether the original from which 
the copy is to be made is a positive or negative, and whether the copies are desired 
in positive or negative form. 

There are two processes resembling 
the photolithographic and photogelatin processes, but adapted to the reproduction of 
large black-on-white drawings or maps. The 
first is the reversing positive or Van Dyke 
process. It sometimes happens that there 
will be some advantage in making a photo-offset metal sheet directly from a black-on-white original. This is especially likely to be useful in the reproduction of maps. 
A British army engineer by the name of Van 
Dyke devised a method for preparing a metal 
sheet without a photographic negative of 
the master copy. 

The process is first to coat the 
metal sheet with bichromated fish glue and 
then to make a photographic print on it 
from an original tracing or photopositive 
instead of a negative. The glue is hardened, not on the lines and letters, but 
around them. On the lines and letters the 
metal is cleaned bare. If such a sheet 
were put directly on the press it would 
print a black background, leaving the letters white, for the bare metal would accept 
water and the glue would accept ink. 

But the printing quality of the 
surface can be reversed by an ingenious de- 
vice. First, the whole surface is covered 
with ink, no part of it being moistened 
with water. The bare metal, unprotected by 
moisture, takes as much ink as the hardened 
glue. If the sheet were used in that state, 
it would cover the whole paper solid black. {% include columnbreak.html canvas=155 col=2 %}

Then comes the reversing step. Some 
of the ink is sticking directly to the metal; the rest is held to the metal only by 
the film of glue. If the glue is eaten 
away, the ink will fall off. An acid bath 
will attack the glue without touching the 
ink that has adhered directly to the metal. 
The metal sheet is immersed in acid, and 
when the acid has done its work the hardened glue falls off, bearing the ink with 
it. The metal then shows a surface of 
lines or letters formed in ink with bare 
metal between them. If this sheet is put 
on the offset press and the bare metal moistened with water, it will print like any 
other photolithographic sheet. The inked 
parts of the metal continue taking ink, the 
moistened parts continue taking water and 
rejecting ink. 

A process which has been called 
Ordoverax and is given the name Lithoprint 
by the Lithoprint Company of New York, Inc., 
4] Warren Street, New York City, is the 
second of these methods. As dermaprint arrives as a gelatin adaptation of the mimeograph, so the Ordoverax process appears as 
a gelatin adaptation of blueprinting techniques. The process does not seem to have 
much currency in America except in the books 
about techniques, but its possibilities are 
interesting. A gelatin-covered plate is 
reduced to a gummy condition at a low temperature. An exposed but undeveloped blueprint will transfer its lines to a gelatin 
surface so that the gelatin surface will 
become differentially receptive to ink, 
like a developed photolithographic metal 
sheet. The same result can be obtained by 
bringing a gelatin surface into contact 
with a certain chemical ink. Typewriter 
ribbons can be impregnated with the active 
chemical. The process ought to fit very 
well in the no-man's land of reprinting 
techniques between five and twenty-five 
copies. It is curious that the principle 
has not been developed as an improvement {% include pagebreak.html canvas=156 %} of the hectograph, for the hectograph already uses a gelatin surface. Price data 
on the process are not easily obtainable, 
nor are the writers certain of any firm 
that uses it, although certain blueprint 
firms claiming to do work by "secret" processes may be using this one. 

The Van Dyke process is used principally for map work, the lithoprint method 
for multiplying drawings upon linen. The 
costs of both processes act like normal 
book production costs: there is a large 
initial cost in preparing the copy and a 
smaller running cost for the production of 
additional copies. The Lithoprint Company 
charges $.06 per square foot in quantities 
of six copies or over, with a minimum 
charge of one square foot for each drawing. 
The purchaser does not get the advantage 
of declining costs with the increase of 
edition size beyond six. 

A third process, which is known by 
several trade names, uses a direct-on-tracing-cloth method. It is a process whereby 
a Van Dyke negative is employed. The Van 
Dyke negative is placed upon a sensitized 
tracing cloth, which is exposed to light 
in a vacuum frame, developed, and washed. 
From this waterproof tracing cloth, a number of blueprints can be made, and the need 
for hand tracing is entirely eliminated. 
Prices for tracing-cloth reproductions 
start at $.65 per square foot, with reductions in price starting at fifty square 
feet. 


## Blueprinting and Photostating (First Costs Low, Running Costs High) 

Most of the processes of the blueprint type exhibit a different kind of cost 
behavior, resembling manuscript costs of 
the period prior to the invention of printing. The second copy costs almost as much 
as the first copy; there are very small 
savings to be obtained by increasing the 
size of the edition. This situation is 
normal in all those photographic processes 
which count upon sensitizing the surface 
of the paper that is to be used rather than 
sensitizing the printing surface and then 
printing with ink on ordinary paper. The 
machinery for making copies by these processes is always some kind of frame in which 
the original and the sensitive paper are 
held in contact and exposed to light. The 
costs are usually quoted in square feet. {% include columnbreak.html canvas=156 col=2 %} The differences are principally differences in the character of the sensitized surface spread on the paper. 

There are two ways of transferring 
an image to sensitized paper: directly, by 
holding the sensitive surface in contact 
with the text that is to be copied and 
forcing the light through it; indirectly, 
by using a lens, and reflecting light from 
the text to the sensitized surface. The 
most common of the direct methods is the 
blueprint technique, the most common of the 
indirect methods the photostat. The direct 
methods always reproduce the original without altering its size; the indirect methods 
permit enlargement or reduction. 

There are four kinds of sensitive 
surface that are used commonly for making 
copies "directly" by light transmitted 
through the master copy (i.e., blueprinting). These are: 

1. Ferroprussiate (blueprint) 
2. Ferrogallic (indigo black print or gallic print) 
3. Sepia, sometimes called Van Dyke 
4. Ozalid and BW paper 

The ferroprussiate sensitive paper 
for blueprinting is often manufactured by 
the blueprinting companies themselves, according to various formulae which yield 
surfaces of different degrees of sensitivity. It is darkened by exposure to the 
light and fixed by washing in water. The 
ferrogallic print is made in the same way, 
but it is more costly and is not used much 
in this country. It also has the disadvantage that it is not permanent and that it 
requires very careful timing of exposure 
to prevent spoilage. The sepia print surface is sensitized with silver salts and 
therefore bears a certain chemical resemblance to photostat paper. All these sensitized surfaces are alike in that they 
will make a white-on-dark copy of a black-on-white object. Ozalid paper is exposed 
exactly as if it were a blueprint paper; 
then it is placed in an airtight box in 
which ammonia fumes are released. The ammonia fumes darken to a dark red the lines 
on the paper that have not been exposed to 
light. Therefore a dark-on-white copy can 
be made at one step from a black-on-white 
original.

permit a variety of results in copying by one or another of the blueprint 
techniques. The original copy must 
always be a strong black-on-white, and 
the paper or cloth must be reasonably 
translucent. By making from this original black-on-white a white-on-brown 
sepia (Van Dyke) copy, and then using 
the white-on-brown "negative" sepia 
copy for producing additional blue or 
sepia (Van Dyke) "positive" prints, 
the blueprint technician can produce 
copies that resemble the original in 
being dark on a white ground. The B-W 
process is simply a short-cut to this 
result. 

In the terminology of the trade, a 
"blueprint" is always a print in which 
white lines appear on a blue ground. 
reverse of a blueprint is a "blue line 
print," in which blue lines appear on a 
white ground. The B-W process yields a 
black line on white, and Ozalid gives a 
deep red line on white. In making a blue 
line print, it is customary to make first 
a Van Dyke negative (white lines on dark 
ground), and then, in a second exposure, 
make a blue line print from the Van Dyke 
negative. If a dark brown line is desired 
instead of a blue line, the paper used in 
the second exposure is the more expensive 
Van Dyke or sepia. The blue line and the 
brown line prints cost more than ordinary 
blueprints because they must be run more 
slowly through the machine. A photostat 
negative can be used in making a blue line 
or Van Dyke print, but the results are inferior. If, however, the photostat negative is made with a "paper negative" paper, such as the Kodalith or Photostat N 
paper, the results are equal to those obtained with a Van Dyke negative. 

The production of blue line or Van 
Dyke prints from paper negatives offers 
very interesting possibilities in the reprinting of books in very small editions. 
Unfortunately, it is impossible to get accurate price data, for the cost of production of paper negatives of this type is always included in the price of photo-offset 
work. The paper negative that can be used 
in the blueprint technique is exactly the 
same as the paper negative used in photo-offset work. Since prices are not quoted 
in the trade, it is necessary to make estimates of cost. {% include columnbreak.html canvas=161 col=2 %}

The cost per square foot of paper 
negative is about three times the cost of 
photostat paper. The paper negative can be 
purchased in long rolls and used in the 
photostat. The cost of changing from one 
paper to the other in a photostat would be 
substantial, but it would be absorbed if 
the total amount of work to be done would 
be enough to use up a whole roll of paper 
negative---300 to 500 square feet. Apart 
from the loading of the roll of paper, 
there should be no labor costs to render 
the paper negatives more expensive than 
photostat negatives. The formula for the 
lowest reasonable price for paper negatives 
should therefore stand about as follows: 
multiply the cost of the paper by three and 
add the same non-paper cost (labor, chemicals, overhead, profit) that is shown on a 
photostat price list. An ordinary photostat 8½″) x 11″ costs $.25 a page if one 
to five pages are ordered, and $.15 a page 
if 100 or more are ordered. There is no 
point in considering the production of a 
few pages, because of the labor cost of 
changing the paper in the machine. In the 
100-page unit, the cost of photostat paper 
is $3.34, while the price of the finished 
photostat copies is $15.00. If the higher-priced paper negatives were used instead of 
photostat paper, the paper cost would be 
about $10.00, or $6.66 more than the ordinary paper; then the price of the finished 
copies could not be less than $21.66, and 
would probably be more. 

Another way of figuring the differences is to consider the quoted price of 
photostats utilizing a roll of paper 350′ 
x 18″. The ordinary paper costs $18.70 in 
this amount, and the paper negative $50.50. 
This amount of paper is used in photostat 
work that, at ordinary prices, costs $119.00. 
The substitution of paper negative for ordinary photostat paper should increase this 
price by $31.80, bringing the total to 
$150.80 instead of $119.00. It is evident 
that the paper negative must cost about 50% 
more than the ordinary photostat paper. If 
the trade should develop business in this 
line, the differential would probably be 
greater, but for purposes of estimating in 
this chapter, the 50% differential will be 
used. It will be assumed that if photostats could be made for $100.00, the same 
material could be put on paper negatives 
for $150.00. {% include pagebreak.html canvas=161 col=2 %}

## Maximum Use of Area 

The standard dimensions in which 
square footage measurements and prices are 
calculated in the blueprint industry are 
shown on the chart. Any area over 42″ in 
width gives rise to a surcharge. The ordinary book or typescript page is too small 
a unit area to utilize the blueprint economically, but pages can be pasted together in large sheets to fit one or another 
of the fixed dimensions that are the basis 
of the price structure. Thus it would cost 
$.03 to blueprint a page 6″ x 9″; but if 
four such pages were pasted together, the 
area of 18″ x 12″ would be blueprinted for 
$.045, a price per page of $.0125 instead 
of $.03.

The master copy for a book to be 
reproduced by the blueprint technique 
should always be envisaged as a large sheet 
consisting of pages pasted together. The 
large sheet can then be folded and cut and 
bound with the fold at the outside edge---a style of binding used in Chinese book publishing. This makes a book with each page 
doubled, so that the blank surface is folded in. The blueprint book will then offer 
the reader the convenience of a book with 
printing on both sides of the page. Another method is simply to cut up the large 
blueprint sheets into separate pages. 

In blueprinting, as in photo-offset, 
the master copy can be a photostat negative. 
It may be an enlargement or a reduction 
from the size of the original text. The 
principle of maximum utilization of area 
requires that the pages be of such size 
that they will fit without wastage on one 
of the blueprint areas. Blueprint reproduction is well adapted to the production 
of editions of less than fifty copies. 

## Prices per Square Foot 

Without losing sight of the fact 
that the copy must be made to fit the standard dimensions of the industry in order to 
obtain effective square footage prices, the 
calculation of the cost of multiplying 
texts by the different blueprint techniques 
can be made from the following price list. 

Though the blueprint processes have 
not been used in book production, they have 
been used in a number of cases to duplicate 
records. They have been called into service by college registrars to make transcripts of academic records. Mr. Daniel {% include columnbreak.html canvas=162 col=2 %} Rich of the University of Michigan has compiled a statement of the relative merits 
of the B-W process and the photostat for 
making these copies. Registrar E. B. 
Stevens of the University of Washington 
found that he could make copies of transcripts at $.075 each by the B-W process, 
counting cost of labor and material. There 
is a society which collects biographical 
material by interviews with prospects who 
are flattered by being told that they are 
distinguished people. The society then deposits the biographical notes in a central 
office, from which it offers to distribute 
B-W copies. These uses of the B-W process 
indicate a most interesting quality. When 
material is deposited in the form of loose 
sheets written in strong black on the right 
kind of white paper, the B-W process will 
permit the making of inexpensive copies of 
the original upon demand. 

## Copying of Documents without a Camera 

### a) Direct Contact Copying 

There are two ways of directly 
copying documents without the use of a camera and, hence, without reduction or enlargement. If the original document is 
printed on one side of the page and the 
page has a fair degree of uniformity and 
transparency, a contact print can be made 
from it directly and using a minimum of 
equipment if a paper such as Insurance 
Bromide (sold by Eastman), Ad Type paper 
(Eastman), or Kodalith paper (Eastman) is 
used. This is a valuable process for the 
individual scholar who may wish to make 
copies with a minimum of equipment, whether 
in his own home or study or where photostat 
service is not available. It is a process 
well-suited to the copying of music written 
on one side of the sheet, for the musician 
may wish to make a photographic copy of 
borrowed sheet music. 

The cost of materials is simply the 
cost of the photographic paper plus the 
chemicals. The equipment is cheap and consists of a safelight, printing frame, or 
sheet of thick plate glass, and convenient 
dishes for developing, washing, and fixing. 
Any darkened room will serve for the work. 
It should preferably be equipped with electric lighting so that two points or a double plug are available, one for any ordinary electric light bulb and the other for 
the safelight or red bulb lamp. {% include pagebreak.html canvas=163 %}

In the case of documents which have 
become yellow with age, improved results 
can often be obtained by printing through 
a yellow glass such as the Wratten No. 12 
filter or the Wratten Series 00 safelight. 
In such a case the prints are best made on 
a paper sensitive to green light such as 
Kodalith Ortho or Insurance Bromide. Even 
a lighted match can serve as a source of 
light in this direct method. 

In copying an ordinary page, say of 
typescript, a piece of photographic printing paper is laid face up and the typescript 
paper face up on top of it. The two are 
held together with a piece of glass or in 
a printing frame, and the light is turned 
on over them for the appropriate time. The 
paper is then developed and fixed and comes 
out as a negative copy not unlike a photostat copy, though with less definition and 
contrast. The definition is not so good 
because the thickness of the photographic 
paper comes in between the surface it is 
desired to copy and the sensitive surface. 
If the paper is very thick, or of very 
close texture, or very dense, then it will 
be practically impossible to obtain good 
sharp negatives in this way. In these circumstances it will be necessary to place 
the printed side of the page in contact 
with the sensitive paper, print for the required time, and develop to a negative 
which will be laterally reversed. In order 
to secure a final positive, a contact print 
will have to be made from this on another 
sheet of paper. 

### b) Reflection Copying 

If the page from which the copy is 
to be made is printed on both sides, then 
a different process is necessary. Clearly 
it would not be possible to print through 
the page. The process to be employed in 
this case is known as the "reflection copying" or "reflex" process and was originally known as the "Playertype" since it was 
first put to practical use by an Englishman named Player towards the end of the 
last century. 

In this process a piece of black 
paper is placed under the page to be copied 
and a piece of photographic paper of high 
contrast and orthochromatic, such as 
Kodalith Ortho (Eastman) or Insurance Bromide, on single weight support is placed 
face down on top of it with the emulsion {% include columnbreak.html canvas=165 col=2 %} side of the photographic paper in contact 
with the printed surface it is desired to 
reproduce. The two must then be pressed 
into very close contact with a heavy piece 
of plate glass or in a pressure printing 
frame. This can be helped by using a thin 
sheet of felt behind the black paper under 
the page to be copied. The exposure to 
light is made through the back side of the 
photographic paper, the exposure depending, 
of course, on the light source and the distance from it and the speed of the paper 
used. If the copy obtained in this way is 
developed, fixed, washed, and dried, it will 
be a laterally reversed image of the page, 
and it can be used to make an unreversed 
positive copy of the page by making a contact print from it on another piece of paper. It is not absolutely necessary to 
make a positive, although it is usually 
more convenient to do so. The negatives 
may be read by a transmitted light, especially if the paper is on a fairly translucent single-weight support. The contact 
print from the original negative can be 
made while the negative is still wet after 
washing, and in this way time can be saved. 

The contrast in this process can be 
improved considerably if the original negative is made by printing in yellow light 
rather than white light. For this purpose 
the Wratten Series OO safelight or the 
Wratten No. 12 filter is quite satisfactory,
and the printing paper must be orthochromatic such as Kodalith Ortho or Insurance Bromide. A suitable printing lamp can be made 
by using a regular pyramid safelight containing the Series OO glass, and costing 
$3.00. 

The cost of copying pages) by this 
method as compared with copying pages 
printed on one side only of a thin sheet 
of paper is in the extra sheet of bromide 
paper required. 

## The Photostat 

The best established of the copying 
methods on photosensitive paper is the 
photostat method. In the photostat as in 
the blueprint processes, the unit cost does 
not diminish as the size of the edition increases. But it can be made to diminish by 
reducing the dimensions of the pages copied, 
and hence cutting down at once on the legibility of the finished product and the area
of the photographic paper used. This {% include pagebreak.html canvas=166 %} possibility raises in connection with the 
photostat the same problem of reduction of 
type size that appeared in connection with 
photolithography. 

In photostating, operating and 
equipment costs both enter into consideration, for the photostat apparatus is often 
owned and operated by research institutions 
themselves. 

The costs of photostatic copies 
are governed principally by the cost of 
the photostat paper. The price per square 
foot of a light-weight stock is about $.04, 
But in the preservation of research materials use may be made of the special "H" 
or "HH" grade of permanent paper stock, 
manufactured by the Byron Weston Company. 
The "H" grade, which is coated on one side, 
sells for $.052 per square foot; the "HH" 
grade, which is coated on both sides and 
hence will bring a saving of half the cost 
of binding the volumes, sells for $.092 
per square foot of paper or #.04 ¾ per 
square foot of sensitive surface. 

When wastage has been taken into 
account and the variations due to the different ways of imposing the negative and 
cutting the paper from rolls of different 
widths has been reckoned with, the cost of 
paper for photostating a 100—page book in 
different page sizes and with different 
grades of paper is as follows below. 

To these costs of paper there must 
added the costs of labor and chemicals. 
The New York Public Library and the printing department of the Cleveland Bell Telephone Company very kindly contributed {% include columnbreak.html canvas=166 col=2 %}
statements of their operating costs. In 
the New York Public Library the great majority of the prints were 11½″ by 14″, 
usually one copy only, and the average cost 
of the paper was $.055. In the Telephone 
Company the average size of paper was 
8½″ x 11″, and in many cases several 
copies of the same object were required. 
The cost of the paper averaged $.03 per 
page. In the Public Library the $.055 
worth of paper requires so much reference 
and clerical work that the cost of the finished print rises to $.193 each. In the 
Telephone Company, where only operating 
room charges need be considered, the $.03 
worth of paper is worked up into a print 
which costs $.063. This means that labor, 
depreciation, and chemical supplies cost 
$.033. These operating room costs in the 
Public Library amount to $.06. The figures 
in total operating room cost are as follows: 


| | Library |Telephone Co. | 
|----|----:|----:|
| Paper (per 100 pages) | $5.50 | $3.00 | 
| Operating costs (") | 6.00 | 3.30 |
| | $11.50 | $6.30 |
| Cost per square foot for paper, labor, and chemicals | $0.10 | $0.084 | 

The Public Library spends an additional 
$.082 on every page to cover clerical help, 
postage, and desk supplies--charges which 
are due to the special character of the

{% include pagebreak.html canvas=171 %} library work. The inescapable operating 
costs are 10% more than the cost of the paper and may be more than twice the cost of 
the paper. This percentage is reduced as 
the work becomes more continuous. The life 
insurance companies operate with highly 
standardized copy; their labor costs should 
be very low, but the writer has not been 
able to secure statements from them. The 
work of the Massachusetts Historical Society in copying colonial newspapers made 
use of the photostat at its highest efficiency for the reproduction of research 
materials. A letter from the director, Mr. 
Worthington C. Ford, explains the financing 
of this enterprise: 

> ...we gave our operator the highest 
  photostat salary paid within my 
  knowledge and with that the cost of 
  material represented twice the cost 
  of labor. I roughly estimated that 
  it cost us about $.13½ to make a 
  page of a newspaper of the large 
  size...but we printed some which required the largest size of sheet 
  adaptable to the photostat machine, 
  and the average cost was not increased. We sold the newspapers at 
  a fixed price of $.15 per page. Some 
  years there was a profit of $300--$400 and some years we came out even. 

Similar newspaper photostating by the University of Michigan Library and John Carter 
Brown Library are being carried on at a 
rate higher than that charged by the Massachusetts Historical Society. The Library 
of Congress estimates that its photostat 
copies of foreign archive material cost it 
$.15 each, and the British Museum and 
Bodleian Libraries show a cost of $.06 a 
page quarto size. It can be concluded 
that every dollar's worth of photostat paper requires from $.50 to $1.10 in operating expenses. 

Commercial prices for photostating 
service are standardized on the basis of 
four sizes: 8½″ x 11″; 11″ x 14; 14″ 
x 18″; and 16″ x 24″. The price falls 
with the number of pages copied, from the 
high of $.25 a page (8½″ x 11″) when 
one page only is copied, to the low of 
$.15 when 100 pages are copied. The following table charts the prices of any number of pages from one to 100, in any of {% include columnbreak.html canvas=171 col=2 %}
the four sizes. The price falls by $.01 a 
page with every increment of five pages. 
This table will be used in making estimates 
of cost of photostat work, although actual 
photostat service may be available at lower prices in some places, or may cost more 
elsewhere. A spread of two book pages, 6″ 
x 9″, will go on a photostat page 14″ x 18″. 
If slightly reduced in size, two pages 
would go on one photostat page 11″ x 14″, 

The "number" is the number of photostat sheets, and may be either duplications 
of the same pages or reproductions of successive pages of a book. The price is the 
total price of the number of sheets, but 
opposite each price group is a unit cost 
figure indicating price-per-page. 

## Photocopying Equipment 

The two appliances which compete 
in the field of photographic copying are 
the photostat (Figure XXXVIII) and the 
Rectigraph (Figure XXXIX). The photostat 
is the better known and has succeeded in 
making a common noun of its trade name. 
The differences between the two kinds of 
apparatus do not seem to be sufficiently 
important to have a decisive effect upon 
costs but are worth noting because they illustrate certain of the practical aspects 
of photostat work. 

Both firms have two kinds of apparatus: a standard equipment, which 
leaves it to the operator to shift the 
prints to a rinsing tank and to dry them; 
and a "continuous photostat" or "super Rectigraph," which carries the prints automatically through the whole process from 
exposure to drying. The highest-priced 
continuous photostat costs $4000.00. The 
claim is made that it will turn out three 
prints a minute. The "super Rectigraph" 
costing $2600.00, is said to deliver prints 
completely fixed, washed, and dried at the 
rate of one a minute. 

The following are the principal 
differences between the two machines. The 
photostat carries the print on an endless 
chain through a developed bath, then 
through a chromium roller which squeezes 
out the surplus developer, into a rinsing 
tank of running water, and then face down 
into a shallow fixing tank which is continuously agitated by a motor. The Rectigraph apparatus grasps the end of the paper and pushes it down into the developer, {% include pagebreak.html canvas=172 %}

TABLE XXVIII 

CHART OF PHOTOSTAT PRICES 

{% include pagebreak.html canvas=173 %} withdraws it up again by the same end, 
passes it through a roller (but not a bath 
of running water), covers its surface with 
the fixing solution, and lets it emerge 
face up in a deep fixing tank. All these 
features are interrelated. An advantage 
of the Rectigraph setup is that as each 
print is made, it can be examined immediately to determine if it is satisfactory, 
thus eliminating considerable wastage. The 
Rectigraph uses a deeper tank because the 
solution is allowed to lie still; the photostat agitates the tank, which must therefore be shallow. The Rectigraph claims 
that it can dispense with the agitating of 
the fixing bath because it covers the whole 
surface of the paper evenly with the solution before it enters the bath. It is 
this covering of the surface prior to immersion in the bath which permits the print 
to appear face up in the tank. The photostat has a much heavier frame, which is 
necessary to resist the vibration caused 
by the agitating of the tank, but which has 
The Rectigraph wastes more paper than the photostat 
because it requires more of a margin at the 
top of the sheet when dipping it into the 
developer. Each company claims that it is 
more saving of chemicals. In the judgment 
of the writer, the photostat has the better claim because the developer is washed 
off in running water before the print enters the fixing tank; although Rectigraph 
points out that their chemicals last longer 
because the tank does not expose as much 
surface to the air for deterioration. 

While it is true in general that 
the cost of photostat copies does not diminish as the edition increases in size, 
there is one significant exception. If 
the user demands a positive copy, the 
photostat process must provide first a negative and then make the positive from that. 
A positive copy therefore involves two 
steps and costs twice as much as a negative. If a number of positive copies are 
required, the cost of the negative can be 
distributed among them, thus reducing the 
cost of each. 

On long jobs further economies in 
the making of photostat positives can be 
effected by reducing the original copy in 
the negative and enlarging it back in the 
positive. The reduction to one-half size 
at the negative stage can result in two {% include pagebreak.html canvas=173 col=2 %}
kinds of economy. Only one-fourth as much 
paper is needed for the negative, and it is 
often possible when copying back to positives to lay down four negatives at once, 
copy them all at one exposure, and thus 
save labor time. These possibilities do 
not materially reduce the cost level of 
photostat operations as compared with other processes. 

The most extreme use of the principle of making the negative small and enlarging it back in making the positive is 
the film-copying and enlarging process. If 
the negative copy is made with a very great 
reduction---say sixteen diameters---on film, 
it can be enlarged back on photostat paper 
with an ordinary film enlarger. This process will yield positive copies on photostat 
paper for very little more (in some cases 
for less) than the cost of the negative 
photostat. The combination of film copying with photostating is important because 
it redistributes the labor of making photographic copies. One man can go off into 
the wilds with a small camera to make film 
copies, while leaving the work of enlarging 
to be done at another time and place. 

Although the apparatus has not yet 
been designed, it would be very easy to 
make a semi-automatic machine for enlarging from film to paper. The only equipment 
to be added to the standard enlarger would 
be an automatic stepping device to move the 
film, one frame at a time, before the lens. 
Large-scale copying work from film to paper 
has already demonstrated that one worker 
can do as many as 2000 sheets a day. With 
automatic apparatus this may be increased 
to 3000 pages. At such levels the costs of 
making positives on paper approach the materials costs, for ten dollars worth of labor will use up fifty dollars worth of materials. As will be pointed out in a later 
chapter, such cost situations introduce a 
temptation to reduce the size of the paper 
print to the lowest level of legibility. 

Another automatic device is operated by the Recordak Corporation. This is 
a continuous process machine for transfering a roll of film to an enlarged roll of 
paper. This service brings the price of 
the photostat copy to a point very near the 
price of the photostat paper. 

The whole field opened by film 
copying in reduced sizes will be discussed 
in a later chapter. For the present it is {% include pagebreak.html canvas=174 %}
sufficient to note that film copying and 
enlarging will yield positive copies on 
photostat paper for approximately the price 
of negative photostats. 

## The Dexigraph 

Another type of photocopying equipment is the Dexigraph, (Figure XL), manufactured by Remington Rand. It is a fixed 
focus camera, copying from a fixed size of 
object to a fixed size of copy. One of 
its principal uses in scholarship is for 
the reproduction of library catalogue cards, 
although as with the other photostatic apparatus, it is also used for registrars' 
records, transcripts, etc. 

Miss Anna M. Monrad, Head Cataloger of the Yale University Library, has 
written an article on the experience of 
Yale Library in using the Dexigraph to 
make an official catalogue.[^n1] Miss Monrad's 
article tells of experience with the automatic Dexigraph; Dr. Frederick Hicks, Law 
Librarian of Yale Law Library, in the article, "Reproduction of Catalogue Cards by 
Photographic Methods,"[^n2] gives an account 
of experimentation with the Junior Dexigraph, using the machine as a substitute 
for the typewriter. Computations made for 
a six weeks! period indicated that dexigraphing 5,417 cards, including material, 
labor, chemicals, machine rental, and 
wastage, cost $.03507 per card (5,211 usable 
cards resulting); typing 5,211 cards cost 
$.033 per card. Dr. Hicks stated that 
even if the typing method were cheaper, 
the use of the Dexigraph would still be 
justified because of the factors of speed 
and accuracy. Other users include the 
Universities of California, Illinois, Missouri, and Notre Dame. 

Dexigraph units are leased, not 
sold. The Junior Dexigraph, handling copy 
up to letter and legal size, is leased for 
from $10.00 to $25.00 per month. With 
this model an operator can Dexigraph from 
200 x 400 prints an hour. The junior 
Dexigraph is portable and occupies only a 
few feet of space. The automatic Dexigraph 
handles all copy from 7½cm. x 12½cm. 
up to and including 8½″ x 14″, and is 
recommended for mass reproduction. The 
rate of 3,000 cards an hour is claimed for {% include columnbreak.html canvas=174 col=2 %}
it. It can be leased for a one-year period for $50.00 a month, but Remington Rand 
ordinarily uses it on a contract basis 
when a specific assignment for a job of 
some magnitude is required. 

Dexigraph copies, like photostat 
copies, are produced as negatives. Sensitized paper is used, and it comes in pre-cut or roll form. The price varies according to weight, size, and type of paper. 
Standard Record paper ranges in price from 
$6.80 per 1,000 sheets 5″ x 3″, up to $32.00 
for 1,000 sheets 8″ x 8″; Permanent Record 
paper begins at $8.80 per 1,000 cards 5″ x 
3″ and goes up to $39.75 for the 8″ x 8″ 
size; Duplex Permanent Record paper is more 
expensive. The roll paper is priced from 
$8.60 to $19.00, according to weight and 
size. Permanent Record paper is heavier 
than Standard Record paper and is sensitized 
on a paper stock resembling an all-rag 
stock. Dexigraph claims that the cost of 
labor, chemicals, material, etc., for centimeter cards should not exceed $.02 each 
where a quantity is involved; the legal 
size documents run about $.07 each. Both 
these figures include machine rental. 

Through the use of a color filter, 
colored paper can be copied. The turn of 
a dial varies the amount of light entering 
and consequently determines the amount of 
contrast desired. 

Ira W. Smith, in a report of April; 
1934, on methods of duplicating records, 
says that the University of California at 
Berkeley used the Dexigraph and made prints 
at a cost of approximately $#.03 each, including cost of paper, developing materials, 
and labor, when the volume of work was fairly large. The cost when only a few prints 
were made at a time was about $.07 each. 

## The Technological Frontier 

It is to be hoped that a means may 
be found to combine the economies due to 
saving of material in film copying with 
those due to labor saving in the Dexigraph. 
It should be possible to develop an automatic machine for enlarging film copies to 
a fixed size. Such a device would bring 
photostat costs down very close to mere 
photostat paper costs. If such a device 
should then be developed to take full 

{% include pagebreak.html canvas=175 %}

FIGURE XL 

The Dexigraph 

{% include pagebreak.html canvas=176 %}

{% include pagebreak.html canvas=177 %}

advantage of the possibility of saving 
photographic surface by reducing the size 
of the reading matter, photostatic copies 
might enter a new cost level and hence acquire a new importance in the strategy of 
scholarship. The Joint Committee has 
heard that there is some prospect of development along this line. 

[^n1]: "The Use of the Dexigraph in Making an Official Catalog," *Library Journal*, March 1, 1932. 

[^n2]: A paper read at American Law Library Convention in Montreal in 1934. 

Typescript can serve as the master 
copy from which B-W and blueprints are 
made, provided it is written with a very 
black ribbon. It can serve as master copy 
for the photostat process without special 
preparation. To bring together all the 
processes for multiplying a typescript 
book, it is only necessary to imagine that 
a typescript of lOO,000 words as submitted 
for multiplication in the form of a fair 
copy, 334 pages, 8½″ x 11″. 

How shall this be multiplied? It 
can be retyped for the format copy and reproduced by hectograph, mimeograph, or 
photo-offset. It can be photostated full 
size, half size, or in some intermediate 
size. If it happens to be typed in sufficiently dark print on the right kind of paper, it can be reproduced directly by any 
of the blueprint processes. If it is not 
sufficiently contrasted for the direct use 
of a blueprint process, it can be photostated and blueprints made from the photostat negatives. Each of these processes 
will result in a legible product; the exact differential in legibility is difficult 
to estimate. Each of them will exhibit its 
principal cost advantages at a particular 
part of the rising curve of edition size. 

## Comparative Costs in Book Production 

It is now possible to compare costs 
of blueprint, photostat, and photo-offset 
in book production. 

The original to be reproduced may 
be either a printed book or a.pile of typescript. An octavo book of 100,000 words, 
6″ x 9″ page, with 400 words to the page 
would cover ninety-four square feet. A 
typescript of normal format, 300 words to 
the page, would require 334 pages, 8½″ 
x 11″, or 217 square feet. 

The alternatives that present themselves in the reproduction of these texts 
are (a) typescript copying, (b) photostat, 
(c) blueprinting, and (d) photo-offset. 

Six of these processes (blueprint, 
blue line print, Van Dyke negative, Van {% include columnbreak.html canvas=177 col=2 %}
Dyke positive, B-W, and Ozalid) are incapable of enlarging copy or reducing it, and 
equally incapable of dealing with such a 
thing as a book with pages printed on both 
sides. Those that involve the use of the 
photostat are adapted not only to the reproduction of book pages, but also to the 
making of reductions. Since area is the 
governing factor alike in first and running costs, the cost levels are highly sensitive to reductions in size. in this respect, blue lines prints or Van Dykes positives *from paper negatives* yield productions at costs just as elastic as those encountered in photo-offset and analyzed in 
the preceding chapter. That is to say, a
reduction of approximately 30% in the size 
of the page will reduce costs by 50%. The 
6″ x 9″ page would have to be reduced to 
something like 4″ x 6″; the 8½″ x 11″ 
page to something like 5½″ x 8½″, to 
effect this reduction in cost. 

In respect of size of edition, the
zones in the neighborhood of five copies,
and again in the neighborhood of twenty-five copies, show themselves as the most 
sensitive. They are the meeting points of 
the different techniques. Carbon copying, 
Ozalid, and B-W copying come very close together at the fifth copy; photo-offset, 
photostat, and Van Dyke positives meet each 
other close to the twenty-five mark. 

The key figures for the cost of 
reproduction (full size) are on page 79. 

Photostat and photo-offset cross 
each other in the reproduction of the octavo book at the twenty-five copy line. 
the reproduction of the typescript page 
they meet at a smaller edition---thirteen 
copies. That is to say, in an edition of 
thirteen copies the photo-offset of an 
8½″ x 11″ page will cost the same as the 
photostat, and there will be eighty-seven 
extra photo-offset copies, the cost of 
which has been absorbed in the edition of 
thirteen. 

Why is there this difference? 
Chiefly because the negatives in the dimension 6″ x 9″ can be laid on the frame for 
photostating in a very economical way, and 
eight pages can be copied at a time. 

Another fact must be noted: the 
photostat and blueprint techniques are all 
elastic in that additional copies can be 
run at constant cost, once the first costs
are assumed. With the photo-offset {% include pagebreak.html canvas=178 %}

The foregoing discussion has dealt 
with printed and typescript texts. It is 
important, however, to take into account 
the fact that all the blueprint, photo-{%- include columnbreak.html canvas=179 col=2-%}offset, and photostat processes will reproduce charts, figures, and line drawings 
as easily as texts. This aspect of the 
problem of reproducing research materials 
will receive more complete analysis in the 
next chapter.
