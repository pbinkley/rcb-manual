TABLE IX 

| | PRINTING | MIMEOFORM | PHOTO-OFFSET |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| First Costs (composition) | Varies directly with number of words or ems, and only slightly affected by type face, leading, etc. Time and a half and double time are charged for footnotes, tabular matter, etc. |  Varies directly with number of words or ems, and only slightly affected by type size, type face. Composition about 30% less compact than for ordinary printing. Cost reckoned on a page basis. All type sizes on a 12-point body. | No composition costs for reprinting. (The behavior of typescript composition costs will be analyzed in the next chapter. |
| First Costs (area) | Make-up varies directly with number of forms and complexity of work) (e.g., footnotes, illlustrations, tabular matter, etc.). Make-ready varies in the same way as make-up. Neither is affected by size of edition. | No make-up since type is automatically transferred to multigraph drum by monotype caster. No make-ready. | The step the equivalent of make-up in printing is the preparation of plates. The cost equals that of make-up and make-ready in printing of small editions. Practically no make-ready. |
| Running Costs | Varies directly with size of edition, number om forms, grade of paper, and type of binding. | Variations similar to those in printing. Since pages are printed separately, the binding costs rise above those of printed 16-page signatures. | Variations similar to those in printing. Binding costs rise slightly for small press. |
| Reprint Costs | Electrotype takes $1.50 a page. This cost makes new composition costs unnecessary. By storing type or making stereotypes and electrotypes, new composition costs are unnecessary. | None | Storage of metal sheets at $.00 to $.10 per page reduces cost by approximately 50%; storage of negative by about 15%. |
