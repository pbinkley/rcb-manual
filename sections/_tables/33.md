    <td colspan=6><em>Truing up the Illustrative Material</em>: reducing or enlarging photographs to bring them to proper scale. This step in the process is common to all techniques. The author can assume it himself by having all the drawings or photographs in such a size that they can be reproduced in the same degree of enlargement or reduction. A discount of 10% to 30% is usually accorded in quotations on a job that does not call for special truing up of photographs, or one that has all photographic work reproduced in size as submitted, or in the same degree of reduction or enlargement. This discount applies only to plates which scale at less than $5.62 if half tones; $4.28 for zinc etchings.</td>

    <td colspan=6><em>Making Photographic Negatives</em>: apart from the screening, this element in the process is identical for all techniques, but trade practice has standardized the use of the wet plate in photoengraving, while the photo-offset operators utilize film or paper, which is cheaper.</td>

    <td><em>Making the Printing Surface</em></td>
    <td>Zinc line cuts, $5.38 standard price for one 4” x 6” cut</td>
    <td>Illustrative matter and text receive same treatment in preparation of printing surface; cost is simple area cost. See Chapter III</td>
    <td>Copper plate engraving $7.55 standard price for a 4” x 6” cut</td>
    <td>Illustrative matter and text receive same treatment in preparation of printing surface; cost is simple area cost. See Chapter III</td>
    <td>Illustrative matter and text receive same treatment; trade has not developed the production of typescript texts with photogelatin illustrations, but there are no technological obstacles</td>
