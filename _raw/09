CHAPTER IX 





BINDING, VERTICAL FILING, AND FILM STORAGE 


The use of typescript and near- 
print in the production of small editions 
of documents of internal circulation in 
scholarship need not necessarily give rise 
to new library problems. If most of these 
documents turn out to be books of size ap- 
propriate for binding, the librarian need 
not be subjected to any change in routine 
corresponding to the change in the methods 
of distributing written matter among schol- 
2S ble nea showldy develop that. a con= 
siderable proportion of these documents of 
internal circulation are of less than book 
size, the librarian will find that the dif- 
ficulty he already knows with his pamphlet 
problem increases. This problem is al- 
ready supplemented by that of provision for 
books on film. How may the different forms 
of written material entrusted to the li- 
brarian's care be most conveniently and 
economically preserved? What are the costs 
of keeping this material in suitable condi- 
tion for continued use?

ment that is more than half an inch thick 


is likely to be bound and treated as a book. 


Documents of less than that thickness may 
be shelved in pamphlet binders or combined 
in groups to form volumes of ordinary book 
size. An alternative treatment is that 
used for loose-leaf material, that is, to 
store them in vertical filing cases with 
folders and guides to make them easily ac- 
cessible, or to lay them in manuscript box- 
es to preserve them as safely as possible. 
Microcopied material in the form of film 
rolls may be kept in small boxes, labeled 
and shelved like books. Three types of 
costs appear here: filing, binding, and 
library shelving. The latter are discussed

Vertical Filing 
The vertical filing system, rather 








than ordinary library shelving, is used for 
the temporary Storage of items of pamphlet 
or typescript memorandum size. When a con- 
siderable volume of this material accumu- 
lates, two alternatives present themselves. 
If the vertical file system is adopted for 
the permanent storage of pamphlets and 
typescript, the library pays at the rateof 
$5.00 or $6.00 per 1000 pages for storage 
equipment. If the accumulation is bound as 
periodicals are bound, when enough articles 
on a subject have been brought together, 
the cost of binding the contents of a file 
drawer in books averaging one inch in thick 
ness would be from $20.00 to $30.00; in 
books averaging four inches in thickness, 
it would be from $10.00 to $20.00, with a 
button binding being used. The choice be- 
tween these two courses depends as much 
upon the nature of the material itself as 
upon cost considerations. 





(a) Vertical File Material 
A simple form of binding used for 
vertical file material up to forty or fifty 
pages in length is wire stapling. This is 
done with the small stapling machine, cost- 
ing about $5.00, that is part of standard 
office equipment. The cost is almost ex- 
clusively a labor cost. 5000 staples can 
be purchased for $2.00. A worker can sta- 
ple about 500 to 600 documents an hour at 
a labor cost of $.40. Wire stapling by a 
commercial service shop costs about $.02 a 
copy. Machine stapling, including a suit-— 
able paper cover, is available at a cost 
of a few cents a copy. This will take care 
of items up to 1/4" in thickness. Wire 
stapling through the fold is not suitable 
for ordinary typescript on typescript pa- 
per, but att can be used) for any printed sor 
photo-offset items published in one signa- 
ture of sixteen or thirty-two pages. 

Spiral binding is a formof notebook 
binding that is becoming increasingly popular

peared a few years ago in Europe and was

introduced in America through an American 
magazine. It is used fcr pamphlets and 
catalogues in Europe and for small edition 
publications. Loose sheets are held to- 
gether by rings as in the simplest loose- 
leaf notebook style, but instead of two or 
three heavy rings, a series of thin wire 
ones is fastened along one side of the 
sheets to be bound together. The advan- 
tages are that the book lies perfectly flat, 
is absolutely flexible, the inside margins 
are not obscured in any way, and there is 
no trouble with a double spread of page. 
The price is determined by two factors: 
quantity and length of the side to be spi- 
ral bound. An 11" side, which is the com- 
mon sone used ini school's, im quantities of 
1000, with each copy 1/4" in thickness, 
would cost approximately $50.00. The price 
goes down as the quantity increases, 2500 
copies getting a 10% discount; 10,000 hav- 
ing a 20% discount, etc. 

Spiral binding has not been unani- 
mously approved by librarians. They claim 
that it is hard to keep on the shelves and 
meeds more storage space. Also, there is 
no place on the back of the book for title, 
author, or reference number; and this makes 
it necessary to take each spiral-—bound item 
off the shelf to ascertain if it is the de- 
sired copy. The Spiral Binding Company 
suggested the use of labels, to be pasted 
on the shelves immediately below the books 
in question. The question of permanency 
was also raised by the librarians. In an- 
swer to this, tests were made between spi- 
ral binding and thread-sewn books that 
seemed to prove that sheets could be pulled 
out of thread-sewn books more easily than 
out of spiral-bound books. The number of 
rings tends to make a stronger binding. An 
example of its use may be found in Dr. 
Charles C. Peters! thesis material, which 
has been published in reduced-size offset. 


Binding: (b) Pamphlet and Periodical Ma- 
terial 


For items of pamphlet thickness, 
four binding techniques are available: 
namely, the spiral binding and the stapling 
mentioned above, pasting, and wire stitch- 
ing. Pasting, next to 'stapling, is the 
simplest method of fastening sheets of a 
pamphlet together, one fold inside of an- 
other. This method, however, is for bind-— 
ing only a few sheets and is for very tem- 
porary work. 


METHODS OF REPRODUCING RESEARCH MATERIALS 





There are two common methods of 
wire stitching: saddle-and side-wire 
stitching. With saddle-wire stitching, the 
pamphlet is opened in the middle and layed 
face down (or face up). The stitching is 
done on a machine which holds a spool of 
wire from which staples are made and driven 
through the sheets in the fold and clinched 
on the other side. Side-wire stitching is 
the same method, except that the stitching 
is done through the side of the collected 
sheets instead of through the fold. Saddle- 
wire stitching is used when sheets are fold- 
ed as one signature; side—wire stitching ds 
used when two or more Signatures are gath- 
ered side by side. Wire stitchers can be 
used for items up to 1/2" in thickness. 

Pamphlet producers, like periodical 
publishers, usually pass their binding 
costs on to the library. Library binderiles 
have attained a distinct recognition in the 
bookbinding industry in recent years, and 
are now considered as being a separate 
branch of bookbinding. The United States 
Census Bureau, -in its 1925 statistical re= 
port on the binding industry, put library 
binderies in a class by themselves. The 
American Library Association in 1922 had a 
meeting with the Employing Bookbinders of 
Ameria and the two groups drew up some 
principles to be observed in library book- 
binding. 

The library, in assuming the costs 
of pamphlet and periodical binding, some- 
times puts them in separate bindings, but 
usually groups them and binds them into 
volumes for reference. The publishers of 
periodicals generally have the responsibil- 
ity of determining how many issues of a 
magazine constitute a volume. Monthly 
school magazines, usually issued ten times 
a year, form a volume for each ten numbers; 
magazines issued each month during the year 
generally form a volume every six months. 
Extra thick volumes of magazines and news- 
papers must receive special care and usual- 
ly have to have reinforcement in the form

periodical or pamphlet producer uses a suf- 
ficiently heavy cover stock, he can save 
the library the extra cost of pamphlet care 
that is involved in fitting pamphlets into 
binders. 

The only justification for trans-— 
ferring the cost of adequate binding to li- 
braries is a situation in which a substan-— 
tial proportion of an edition is distributed 


, 
|

to users who will not require that it be 
well bound. If an entire edition of a 
pamphlet is to go to libraries which will 
catalogue and shelve it, it might as well 
be bound with boards heavy enough to sus- 
tain library use. If, on the other hand, 
the edition is to go principally to users, 
whether libraries or individuals, who will 
put it in a vertical file, the heavy cover 
boards are not only an unnecessary cost, 
but an actual disadvantage. 


Binding (c) Bookbinding Techniquest 
In the case of books of full stand- 


ard thickness, saddle stitching, side 
stitching, and sewing are most commonly 
used. With side stitching, the pages do 
not lie flat when opened, but must be held 
open; sewed and saddle-stitched books lie 
flat and show the full inside margin. 

Side stitching is done by making 
small holes in the sheets near the back and 
passing the thread through these holes. If 
the stitching is done by machine, punches 
are used to make the holes. 

Saddle stitching is done through 
the folds of the signatures. The stitches 
are made long to prevent weakening of the 
book by too much perforation, Usually a 
Sur LOO mis tim or crash is glued on the 
back for reinforcement. 

In sewed books (and the great ma- 
jority of books are sewed) each signature 
is sewed to its neighbor, so that an un- 


limited number of signatures may be con- 
tained in a book. These signatures are 
piled together and cords or tape are fas- 


tened crosswise across the back in grooves 
made for the purpose and fastened in the 
grooves by kettle stitching. The usual 
number of cords used is five. The finished 
product is a flexible and strong piece of 
work. When the signatures have been gath- 
ered and sewed, the edges are trimmed and 
the back rounded and reinforced with muslin 
Ceecracst lta c during thas reinthorcing 
process that the headbands are added. Then 
the filler is ready for its cover and the 
finishing steps. 

Paper is an important factor in 
binding and should be flexible in propor- 
tion to its size. When the grain of the 
paper runs the same way as the binding edge, 


Binding:

the book will lie flat when opened; if the 
grain runs crosswise of the binding edge, 
the book will not lie flat when opened, but 
will be stronger. In handmade paper, the 
fibers run in all directions, so the paper 
is equally strong in any position. 


(d) Bookbinding Costs 
There are many factors aside from 
the technique of binding that determine the 
cost of bookbinding, which is fundamentally 
el asblabalaliayes (elos\ae, shal leyoxeylie jopstoyeybichealopal, {ys} alice 
increases with the size of the edition. The 
most important factors are: (a) size fac- 
tors: number of pages, signatures, and 
copies, and the size of the book; (b) ma- 
terials factors: weight of paper, number 
of cords or tapes used in sewing, kind of 
cover material (leather, imitation leather, 
buckram, cloth, or paper); (c) style fac- 
Orsi. headbands, treatment of corners 
(round or square), treatment of fly leaves 
(tipped or turned), stamping or lettering, 
and treatment of illustrative material (sig- 
natures or single pages, placed at end of 
book of interleaved with text). : 

Though it is obviously insufficient 
to speak of an "average" library book, 
nevertheless, a sample quotation on the 
cost of bookbinding in a style suitable for 
library shelving will illustrate the gener-

Table XXXVI on the following page, are based 
on a good library binding of cloth vellum, 
linen finish. 

The cost of binding newspapers or 
large quantities of typescript (such as the 
NRA hearings) enters into the cost analysis 
that will help determine whether such ma- 
terials should be preserved by binding and 
Shelving or an microcopy, Lorm. sit 2s sig= 
nificant that the costs of binding a year's 
issue of a newspaper like the New York Times 
(approximately 20,000 pages, twenty-four 
volumes) amounts to $54.00, and storage 
costs would be from $48.00 to $72.00, while 
the cost of storage space required for the 
film copy of the same material would be 
about $1.50. 


Film Storage 
There are three ways of storing 
microcopied material on 16 mm. or 35 mn.

film strips. They can be mounted flat, 
Storedein rolls, or on spools. Flat mount— 
ing on cards (suggested by Mr. Atherton 
Seidell) is adapted only to very short 
strips, no wider than a card used in a ver- 
tical file system--hence 5" to 11" is a 
maximum length of strip. Roll storage is 
adapted to the lengths such as those pro- 
duced in the Leica or EKA camera--5!' to 15". 
The separate lengths of film are placed in 
receptacles which may be either small tin 
pill boxes or larger partitioned metal or 
paper boxes holding twenty-five rolls of 
film. The longer rolls of film require 
spool storage. The Recordak Corporation 
furnishes spools with its film. Each spool

It is not known with certainty how 
much special care of atmospheric condi- 
tions is necessary in the preservation of 
the ordinary cellulose acetate "safety" 
film used in copying documents. The re- 
search under way at the Bureau of Stand- 
ards will result in information upon this 
important cost factor in film storage, The 
storage of nitrate films is very expensive 
because of fire hazards; the storage of 
cellulose acetate films is not complicated 
by any fire hazard.

Text of Thomas W. Lamont's 


apesch last night is on Page 8. 





'Thomas W. Lamont of J. P. Mor 
gan & Co. told the Academy of Po- 
litical Science at its annual dinner In 
the Hotel Astor last night that two 
vital changes were needed as primary 
steps for banking reform im the 
United States—to bring all commer- 
cial banks, large or small, under the 
Federal Reserve System and to es- 
tablish ''sensible" provisions for re- 
gionel branch basking, If such re 
forms were brought about gradually, 
be asserted, they should result in 
"some measure of banking stability." 

Pointing to the fact that 60 per 
eont of the country's banks, with re- 
sources of more than $13,000,000,000, 
were outeide the Federal Reserve 
System, the banker declared that no 
banking system can function ade 
quately with only a limited number 
of banks within it. He asserted that 
despite the great number of bank 
failures in recent years, the country 
still has too many banks, and that 
"thousands of banks lack proper 
safeguards." Banking units should 
be larger than they are, he went on, 
and small, ill-capitalized institutions 
should be merged to gain the advan- 
tages of larger banks, 


Most Failures in Rural Districts, 


'Mr. Lamont emphasized that nearly 
four and one-half times as many 
non-member banks have falled as 
members of the Federal Reserve. 
Most of these failures, be went on, 
were small country banks, under no 
control from the Federal Reserve 
and with such small pafd-in capital 
as to be 'subject to impairment un- 
der the most ordinary conditions of 
difficult times.' Ninety per cent of 
the banks that -alled between 1921 
and 1930, he continued, were in rural 
communities, "subject to the viclssi- 
tudes of crop failures or of the ex- 
pansion and deflation of business 
booms, without any of the protection 
afforded by a parent institution for- 
titled with ample capital and man- 
aged by experienced men." 

Almost ail of the failures of small 
suburban banks around Chicago this) 
year, Mr. Lamont asserted, could| 
have been avoided if the Illinois laws 
had permitted branch banking. He 
id that the lessons must be obvious 
of a situation in which {t was im-| 
possible under the law for the large 
Chicago banks to serve the suburbs 
through branch banks. | 

Mr, Lamont said that mismanage- 
ment of large city banks, although! 
there bad been striking instances of | 
it, was rare compared to mismanage- 
ment of country banks, It was the 
weaknesses in the rural banks that 
Jed to hoarding on a grand scale last 
year, he declared, He went on that 
the need last year was not for curv 
rency, but for credit ald, but that! 
sound credit riske were not available 
for the banks because of the defla- 
tion in security and commodity 
prices. There had never been @ 
fime, he said, when the facilities of 
the Federal Reserve System had not 
been more than ample to meet al) 
legitimate credit needs. 

Confusion In Banking Laws. 

Lazity in granting ¢harters 
banks and in supervising their con- 
duct, Mr, Lamont continued, was @ 
result of the confusion due to the 
varying Federal and State banking 
Jaws, giving forty-nine different sets 
ef banking laws. 

Mr. Lamont assertéd that the Fed- 
eral Reserve System Imad brought 
"immeasurable benefits'' to Ameri- 
an industry and commerce and that 
our plight would have been much 
worse without it. The system's open- 
market policy during the past six 
months, he said, had proved a great

dinner of the Academiy of Political 
Science at the Hotel Astor last 
night, declared that the United |

WASHINGTON, Nov. 18.—While 
President Hoover and his Cabinet 
struggled today with the problem of 
reducing expenditures so that heavy 
additional tax levies would be un-

, discussing the situation, expressed 
hope that such @ solution could be 
found, 
| One point was definitely estab-

President and his advisers, namely: 
that reports that the administration 
would recommend @ program of re-

to the extent of $500,000,000 were 
accurate. Decision:was deferred on 
|whether a formal recommendation 
for tax legislation In the phort ses- 
sion of Congress also would be nec- 
epsary, 

Detajls of the retrenchment pro- 
gram were withheld, but it is known 
that the appropriations sought by 
every department are being carefully 
ansiyzed and that a definite Plan to 
bring the budget to a balance In 1934 
will be placed before Congress to ac- 
cept or reject. 

It Is understood also that the diffi- 
culties of budget balancing for the 
current fiscal year are considered 
virtually insurmountably, even if new 


taxeg are levied which would be/ 
effective in the remaining seven 
months.

Special (o Tau New Yor Trurs, 
Nov. 18.—Presi- 
dent Hoover gave intensive consid- 
eration today to the war debt sug- 
gestions which he will submit to 
Governor Roosevelt at their confer- 
ence next Tuesday, but how far he 
will go in proposing a new approach 
tothe problem remained undisclosed. 

Dividing his time between war 
debts and the framing of the budget, 
Mr. Hooyer held a long session with 
his Cabinet this morning, and this 
afternoon conferred on war debts, 
first with Secretary of State Stimson 
and then with Secretary Mills and 
Director Roop of the budget. After- 
ward it was stated authoritatively 
that the President would have a debt 
plan to submit to the President-elect. 

The question of how far he will be 
Prepared to go with his views, how- 
ever, it wi id, undoubtedly would 
depend upon whether Mr. Roosevelt 
bes definite proposals to offer or 
whether, in the absence of any defi- 
nite suggeations, he will be prepared 
to approve, perhaps with modifica- 
tons, the proposals of the President. 


Roosevelt Ready for Longer Visit. 


A possibility that the discussions 
between Mr. Hoover and Mr. Roose- 
volt might extend beyond Tuesday 
developed today when the Mayflower 
Hotel announced that Governor 
Roosevelt would stay there and had 
made arrangements "definitely" to 
remain over Tuesday night. He has 
not set any time for his departure 
from Washington, it was added, 
the event the war debt discussions 
with President Hoover ct the White 
House continue for several days." 

Reservations also have been made 
at the Mayflower for James A. Far- 
ley, chairman of the Democratic Na. 























tional Committee; Frank C. Walker, | 





its treasurer. and Professor Raymond 
Moley, the President-elect's adviser 
on economic affairs. 

Should the discussion between the 
President and the President-elect get 
nowhere, it was felt in political 
circiea here that the conference Mr. 
Hoover has called for Wednesday 
with leading members of the Senate 
Finance and the House Ways and 
Means Committee may provide 
lea4 for some affirmative approach 
to the debt question. 

In the absence of any direct word 
from the White House or Albany, 
sentiment in Congress appeared to- 
day to be as firmly opposed to the 
re-creation of the Debt Commission 





| for re-examination of the debtor gov- 


ernments' capacity to pay as it is to 
the suspension of the Dec. 15 pay- 
ments, 

Most Senators were of the opinion 
that President Hoover would suggest 
& revival of the Debt Commission, 
and they not only promptly declared 
against such a course but insisted 
that they would stoutly oppose any 
move for deferring of the Dec. 18 in- 
terest payment.

Foreign Relations Committee, how- 
ever, thought that the President,

NEW YORK, SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 19, 


ALBANY, Nov. 18.—Franklin D. 
Roosevelt in his Thanksgiving Day 
Proclamation as Governor today 
called for special consideration for 
|those in distress, including In it = 
Prayer from the Episcopal Book of 
Common Prayer which mentioned 
the 'forgotten man." 

"Remember in pity," says the 
prayer, 'such as are this day desti- 
tute, homelesa or forgotten of thelr) 
| fellow-men. 

This petitfon was chosen because it 
contained an appeal the Governor 
| thought most appropriate to th 
times. His proclamation read: 

I, Franklin D, Roosevelt, Gov- 
ernor of the State of New York, 
do proclaim Thursday, the twénty- 
fourth day of November, in this 
year of our Losd one thousand 
nine hundred and thirty-two, as 
Thanksgiving Day. 

I ask the people of the State to 
come together in families, in com- 
munities and In churches for the 
giving of thanks to God. 

May the many of our people for- 
tunate in their temporal well-being, 
and the many who are bearing the

stress of poverty, unite in the com- 
mon purpose of seeking divine 
guidance toward the greater ex- 
tending of unselfiah charity and 
help im behalf of their fellow- 
men. 

It is fitting that men and women 
of all creeds should join in the 
words of the prayer: 

"O God, almighty and merciful, 
who healest those that are broken 
in heart, and turnest the sadness 
of the sorrowful to joy; let thy 
fatherly goodness be upon all thet 
thou hast cade. 

"Remember in pity such as are 
this day destitute, homeless or for- 





gotten of their fellow-men, Bless 
the congregation gf thy poor. Up- 
lift those who are cast down. 


Mightily befriend innocent sufter- 
ers, and sanctify to them the en- 
durance of thelr wrongs. 

"Cheer with hope all discouraged 
and unhappy people, and by thy 
heavenly grace preserve from fall- 
ing those whose penury tempteth 
them to sin; though they be troubled 
on every side, suffer them not to 
be distressed; though they be pe 
plexed, save them from despair."'

'WENDEL 'SON'S' CLAIM 
REJECTED AS FRAUD 


Foley Throws Out Morris Case 
—To Send Record to Crain 
for "Immediate Action." 





AUTHOR OF PLOT A MYSTERY 


Surrogate Rules After Wedding 
Certificate of 1876" Is Proved | 
Forgery Printed After 1913. 


The claim of Thomas Patrick Mor- 
|ris, Brooklyn house painter, to filial 
kinship with John G. Wendel and| 
through that to rightful ownership | 
of the $30,000,000 Wendel estate was) 
thrown out as 'false and a forgery" 
by Surrogate Foley yesterday. Surro- 
gate Foley announced he would send 
the record to District Attorney Crain, 
with the hope that it would 'receive 
prompt attention, 

Indignant that such cases could 
"come into court rooms," Surrogate 
Foley with a bang of his gavel put 
an end to the claim once described 
by Arthur Garfield Hays, attorney 
for other Wendel claimants, as the 
"most interesting court room mys- 
tery of our time." 

Attorneys for Morris and for the| 
state of Miss Ella von E, Wendel, 
the last of the Wendels, who suc-| 
cessfully fought the claim brought 
by the elderly and ailing Scotsman, 
joined last night in wondering if the 
mystery of who prepared his claim 
would ever be unraveled. They were 
agreed that Morris had not been the 
author of the documents produced by 
him or in his behalf. 

John M. Harlan, trial counsel for 
the estate, which Miss Ella Wendel 
left to various charitable institutions, 
ended the presentation of evidence 
yesterday by proving that the mar 
riage certificate purporting to at- 
test the wedding of John G. Wendel 
and Mary Ellen Devine at Castle 
Garden on June 11, 1876, had been, 
printed by the A. J, Holman Com- 
pany of Philadelphia . makers of 
Bibles, not earlier than 1918 and not 
later than 1923. 

This evidence was put in through 
the testimony of Elbridge W. Stein, 
an examiner of questioned docu- 
ments of many years' court experi- 
ence. Mr. Stein showed how, through 
microscopic and stereoscopic exami- 
nation of the certificate, together 
|with many other similar certificates 
printed by the same company, he 
»had come to his conclusion. 


Traced Through the Years. 


Willlam K, Holman, head of the 
house founded by his grandfather, 
jidentified the certificate by Morris 
as one of a type which the publishers 
had begun including in their family 
Bibles in 1885. Through him Mr. 
Harlan introduced fourteen large 
Bibles, printed in varying years from 
| 1873 to 1923, in each of which was 
a marriage certificate. 

Then Mr. Stein traced through 
these certificates the deterioration of 
ithe plates from which they had been 
jprinted. As the electrotype.was used 
|more and more, it became more and 
more imperfect. Microscopie exami- 
nation, presented through enlarged 
photographs, showed parts of letters 
chipped in some places, worn away 
in others, with various other disar- 
rangements of the typogrephical lay- 
out of the certificate. 

Mr. Stein analyzed particularly the 
worn places on a certificate printed 
im 1913. Then, taking up the Morris 
certificate, he showed every worn or 
defective mark found on the 1913 
certificate. He jumped then to 1923 
and showed that on the Morris cer~ 
tiflcate there appeared other imper- 














fections which were again visible on 
the 1923 certificates, but which had 
not developed in 1913. 

In this way the date of the printing

ROOSEVELT HEARS 
HUNGER MARCHERS 


Surprises Delegation of Three 
by Listening to Pleas and 
Debating With Them. 





THEIR DEMANDS REJECTED; 


As "Private Citizen" He Can't 
Teli Hoover to Clear Their Way 
—Holds State Aid Adequate. 





Bpecial to Tre Naw York Tnoes. 

ALBANY, Noy. 18.—Franklin D. 
Roosevelt surprised three "hunger 
march' Jeadéra today by receiving 
them readily in the quiet of the Ex- 
ecutive Mansion study and reasoning 
with them calmly about thelr de 
mapds. 

Gathered in a semicircle before 
him, the men, one with his collar 
open at the neck, found the Gover- 
nor ready to match statements with 
them in an even-tempered but firm 
mann: 

Secret Service men, guarding him 
ns President-elect, were near by as 
Mr. Roosevelt talked with the 
"'marchers,"" who by thelr own ad- 
mission belonged to a group which 
invaded the Legislature last year. 

Three' main demands were pre- 
sented by the delegation: A special 
session of the Legislature to appro- 
priate $100,000,000 for immediate help 
to the unemployed; an order thtow- 
ing open all the armories in the 
State, and provision of food and 
transportation for the 'hunger 
march" to Washington, and a guar- 
antee that the marchers would not 
be molested by the police of New 
York cities. 

All of these were rejected. by the 
Governor. When he was asked to 
"tell President Hoover to let them 
come to Washington without any in- 
terference,"' he replied emphatically: 

"I am just a private citizen and I 
cannot tell the President to do any- 
thing." 

Members of the Delegation. 

The delegation was composed of 
two New Yorkers, Sam Wiseman, 
chairman, and Richard Sullivan, 
secretary of the conference for 
Winter relief, and Milton Stone of 
Schenectady, chairman of the New 
York State "hunger marchers." 

When word reached Albany Police 
Headquarters that the men were on 
thelr way here, a cordon of local 
police had been sent to guard the 
Executive Mansion, but no trouble 
of any kind erose. 

They had arrived about noon and it 
was obvious from thelr manner that 
they hardly expected a conference 
with the Governor. Since his election 
to the Presidency very few visitors 
have crossed the threshold. 

On hearing the mission of the 
three, the Governor almost at once 
directed that they be brought to his 
study. The secret service men as- 
sembled, as they always do when @ 
delegation calls, and a few minutes 
later the newspaper men were in- 
vited to sit in on the conference. 

Leaning «forward in his chair Mr. 
Roosevelt Matened carefully as the 
three spokesmen voiced their views. 
He continually challenged the ac- 
curacy and reasonableness of their 
statements, But did so almost with- 
out lifting his voice. 

'As they told of their plans, he re- 
marked: 

"Every person has a perfect right 
to travel. Naturally the Governor 
hopes that the police throughout the 
State will exercise humane methods 
and give fair treatment." 

"Yea," retorted Stone. 'We got 
falr treatment on March 2 two years 
ago." 

He was referring to the disorder 
when a group of alleged Communists 
invaded the Legislature to demand 
relief appropriations. Several per-

The fusion movement looking to- 
| Ward Tammany's overthrow in the 
1933 Mayoralty election continued to 
grow yesterday, but the situation 
was complicated by the possibility 
that the real fight for control of the 
city government might be waged in 
the Democratio primary next Sep- 
tember. 

That fight could be made, in the 
opinion of political observers, only if 
Franklin D. Roosevelt used his po- 
sition and prestige as President to 
back an anti-Tammany Democratic 
movement here, a movement that 
would have as its nucleus the Bronx 
organization of Edward J. Flynn. 

It would depend as well, it was 
said yesterday, on the winning to 
the Roosevelt camp of John H. Me- 
Cooey, Brooklyn leader, and the 
breaking up of the McCooey-Curry 
alliance. 

Joseph M. Price, an official of the 


ganizer of the movement in 1913 that 
resulted in the election of John Pur- 
roy Mitchel, announced that a meet- 
ing had been called for Nov. 28, to 
be held at the City Club, to gather 
under one central committee the 
anti-Tammany elements. He empha- 
sized that it merely would be a com- 
mittee to organize a fusion move- 
ment, and that it would not seek to 
pick a candidate for many months. 
Others stressed the danger of com- 
mitting the fusion movement to the 
candidacy of any man at present. 

Among those who have already 
said they would attend the confer- 
ence at *he City Club are Charles C. 
Burlingham, Henry De Forest Bald- 
win, Frederick L. Cranford, Ber 
narg 8. Deutsch, Leo Arnstein, Ken- 
neth Dayton, Kenneth M. Spence, 
Stanley M, Isaacs, Stuart Hirsch- 
man, Raymond V. Ingersoll, Cyrus 
C, Miller, George McAneny,. Lewis 
H. Pounds, Robert E. Simon, Mar- 
tin Saxe and Oswald Garrison Vil- 
lard. 








Tammany Not Alarmed. 


Tammany men expressed confi- 
dence yesterday that Mr. Roosevelt 
would keep hands off the city situa- 
tion, and that even if he did not, 
Tammany could easily win in any 
Democratic primary. Friends of Mr. 
Roosevelt remarked only that it was 
far too early to predict how he 
would deal with the organization that 
first opposed him bitterly and then 
helped gtve-him a large plurality in 
the city. The tendency among vet- 
erana in city politics yesterday was 
to regard the picking of Acting 
Mayor Joseph V. McKee as a fusion 
candidate now or the selection of 
any one else, with the primaries ten 
months away, as premature. 
Endorsement of Mr. McKee as the 
fusion candidate noxt Fall came yes- 
terday from Frederick J. H. Kracke, 
Republican leader of Kings County. 
Samue: S. Koenig, New York County 
leader, has already endorsed Mr. Mc- 
Kee, and Warren B. Ashmead of 


Queens has approved. 

"The Republican organization was 
ready weeks ago to make Mr. Mc- 
Kee its candidate for Mayor,' Mr. 
Kracke said.

Woman Soaght to Slay Papen, 
Sentence to Prison Reveals 





By The Associated Press, 

BERLIN, Nov. 18.—An attempt 
on the life of Chancellor von Papen 
on Tuesday was disclosed today 
when Mrs. Paula Budde was sen- 
tenced by a special court to three 
months' imprisonment for carrying 
a dagger. 

She was arrested in the Chancel- 
lery on Tuesday when she sought 
an interview with Colonal von 
Papen. The Chancellor's secretary 
became suspicious and telephoned 
the police, who said they found a 
@agger 2 foot long concealed in her 
dress. 

The woman's husband testified 
that she had told him she wanted 
to give the Chancellor a mem- 
orandum in the hope that he would 
change his political policies. News 
of the arrest was suppressed at the 
time.

WASHINGTON, Nov. 18.—Bowing 
to the mandate of his State, Senator 
Vandenberg of Michigan today joined 
those demanding immediate resub- 
mission of the Eighteenth Amend- 
ment and Immediate modification of 
the Volstend act. 

The Senator sald he considered the 
two-to-one vote of Michigan citizens 
against their own prohibition act 
"an undeniable mandate' which 
should be "'valldated at once." 

"The vote repealing State prohibi- 
tion In Michigan demonstrates that 
two out of three voters demand a 
change," Senator Vandenberg sald. 
"These emphatic totals came from 
more than a majority of counties in 
all parts of the Commonwealth, The 
result 's an undeniable mand: 
For two reasons it should be vali- 
éated at once: 

"Firat, citizens who have spoken 
#0 convincingly are entitled os a 
right of popular government to the 
earliest opportunity to complete their 
conception of ordered temperance. 

Fears Interlude of Chaos, 

"Second, pending this conclusive 
action, there is an interlude of chaos 
which injects new Infirmity into all 
jaw enforcement, precipitates new 
disputes over Federal and State co- 
operation, shatters morale, and en- 
courages lawless and untaxed liquor 
latitudes. I favor immediate resub- 
mission of the Eighteenth Amend 
ment. A just regard for the rights of 
majorities and the validity of law en- 
forcement demands It." 

He added that the "repeal proposal 
should preserve Federal cooperation 
im protecting self-elected dry terri- 
tory from wet invasion.' 

In conclusion tha Senator sald; 

"I shall not vote to weaken the en- 














forcement of the law as it exists at 


any given time, Whatever the law, 
enforcement is vital, It will be vital 
to any new order, The problem of 
Uquor control is not ended by repeal,

MUNICH, Nov, 18—Whether there 
will soon open a market for German 
beer in United States concerns the 
Bavarian brewery owners less than 
the danger of an exodus of experi- 
enced brewmasters to that country. 

With the export outlook still a masa 
of froth, the heads of some big local 
beer plants serigusly envisage a raid 
on their staffs of trained brewmas- 
ters, it being realized 'that twelve 
years' stoppage of production has left 
the United States short of trained 
hop and barley manipulators. 

In such a menace, one 
brewery head sald, there are also in- 
quiries from New York for waitresses 
of the Hofbrau dynasty capable of 
negotiating twelve steins in each 
hand on each trip, as it is foreseen 
that speedy service will be demanded 
once the faucets are again legally 


opened. 
As for early export prospects, the 





Germans Fear Loss of Brewmasters to Us 
And of Waitresses Who Can Carry 24 Steins 





Special Cebie to Tue New Yore Ties. 


Munich and Nuremberg beer kings 
are indulging in no Sllusions, since 
they realize that, in addition to the 
constitutional hurdle, the probable 
duty on beer would make the capture 
of American markets impossible. 
Pre-war exports of beer from Bavaria 
to the United States did not reach 
any appreciable volume, and it ts not 
expected here that future business, 
once the barriers are removed, will 
attain large proportions, 

An American market will be wel- 
comed, of course, but, as one brewer 
observed, ''there seems to be a lot of 
muddled thought on the other side 
with reference to an early resump- 
tion of Bavarian béer exports, judg- 
ing from the inquiries which pour in 
on us from many points in America," 

This brewer 1s prepared to fill 
orders but warns the cost to the con- 
sumer will be "tall, if the suds ever 
reach their destination,
