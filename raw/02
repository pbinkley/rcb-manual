CHAPTER II 


PUBLISHING AND LIBRARY COSTS: 


The point of reference from which 
the problem of reproducing research materi- 
als must be examined is the system by which 
publishers produce books and libraries ac- 
quire, arrange, and store them for use. The 
iimanciab policies of institutions, the 
stack room and reading room equipment of 
libraries, the training of library person- 
nel, as well as the research habits of 
scholars, are standardized in favor of the 
use of books of several hundred pages, from 
6" to 11" in height, costing the purchaser 
Promee.00n to 8.02 a page. 

There are other forms in which re- 
search material is made accessible, but in 
any of these other forms there is created 
a special problem of finance or adminis- 
tration. Maps, newspapers, "oversize" 
HOOKS. Manuscript collections, films, coll— 
lections of pamphlets and broadsides pre- 
sent special difficulties and cause special 
expenses regardless of their acquisition 
COSI Sie 

Scholarly books published in Ameri- 
ca are sold at an average price of $1.20 
per 100 pages, scholarly periodicals at 
$.70 per 100 pages.! A library dollar buys 
75 pages, approximately 32,000 words, in

The cost accountancy of book pro- 
duction is very complicated, but the basic

they are more nearly constant for any num-

and hence the size of the salable edition, 
is so small that the unit cost of the vol— 
ume rises above the level at which the nor- 
mal purchasing policies of institutions or 
individuals will float the enterprise and 
accomplish adequate distribution, the point 
is reached where commercial and scholarly 
needs conflict with each other. The criti-

edition which can be sold within the nor- 
mal price range. 

Another striking characteristic of 
book costs is the high percentage of the 
sale price which goes to pay for other 
things than manufacturing costs. One uni- 
versity press reports that 23% to 50% of 
all money received goes to pay for distri- 
bution. Another reports that it calculates 
that only 40% of the cost of a book is the 
actual production cost. Two very complete 
estimates and analyses of book costs are 
available in the surveys made by Mr. O. H. 
Cheney and Mr. Donald Bean.® Mr. Cheney 
reports on commercial publishing, Mr. Bean 
on scholarly publishing. Both writers cal- 
culate the disposition of the money actual- 
ly received by the publisher. In the case 
of commercial publishing this is much less 
than the amount paid for the books by the 
consumer, because the retail dealer's prof- 
it of 40% must be included. The commercial 
publisher's dollar is the consumer's $.60. 

The dealer's discount in scholarly 
publishing is reckoned at 30% by Mr. Bean, 
and the calculation is further made that 
the scholarly publisher is subsidized by 
authors and institutions to the extent of 
35% of his costs. Therefore the publish- 
er's dollar in scholarly publishing is the 
consumer's $1.07. For every dollar paid by 
the consumer for a commercial book, the 
publisher gets $.60; for every dollar paid 
retail for a scholarly book, the publisher 
gets $1.07. 


TABLE 





These relationships between cost 
and price must receive further analysis, 
but in the meantime note must be made of 
the distribution which publishers make of 
each dollar* they receive. (See Table I.) 

Part of the larger percentage of 
manufacturing costs found in Mr. Bean's fig- 
ures may be due to the inclusion of some 
items which Mr. Cheney classes as overhead. 
Moreover, Mr. Bean's whole system of ac- 
counting seems to disregard separate books 
after the first year of sales and to total 
revenues from later sales to pay overhead 
costs. If an 18% overhead, presumably from 
sales of ol@ books, is tigured intos sii

The larger manufacturing cost ratio in 
scholarly publishing is the result of the 
smaller edition. 

If every edition were invariably 
sold out, the retail price of a book could 
be fixed by dividing the cost of the whole 
edition into the number of copies and add- 
ing a profit. Actually, because of the 
risk element, the selling price must be much

four times the manufacturing cost. Diack 
Arthur Meiner in the German Boersenblatt 

r proposes a formula® for determining sell- 
¢ ing price, which is illustrated with typi- 
cal figures by Mr. Bean: 


——_ 


ee 


The largest element of print 
cost--the composition or typesetting 
--is a cost per page which is inde- 
pendent of the number of copies print- 
ed. The composition of a 400-page 
book, for example, at $2.25 per page 
is $900.00. If the number of books

cost of composition is $.90 per copy; 
if 10,000 are printed, the cost is 
#$.029 per copy. While other elements 
of printing cost do not decrease so 
markedly as the quantity increases, 
the same principle applies to a lim-

ited extent. Thus the remaining costs 
of paper, presswork, and binding may 
be $400.00 for 1000 copies or $.40 
per copy, and $.31 per copy or $3100 
inv quantities of 10,000 copies: The 
total manufacturing cost per copy of 
this imaginary book is, therefore, 
$1.30 in lots of 1000 copies, and $.40 
per copy in quantities of 10,000 cop- 
ies. Stereotype or electrotype plates 
costing approximately $1.25 per page 
additional have not been included, al- 
though a necessary cost if provision 
is to be made for additional impres- 
sions. 6 


The writer has learned that one 
great university press uses the following 
method of pricing, which bears some re- 
semblance to the Meiner formula: 


Minimum Average 
$1300 $2200 
260 440 
$1560 $2640 
ene 2.935 





5. The formula suggested by Dr. Meiner for pricing this hypothetical book runs as follows: 


Selling price = 


Manufacturing Cost 
1 — (Author's royalty + overhead + profit + retailer's discount) 


The percentages which fill in this formula in ordinary commercial publishing are estimated by 


Bean as follows:

But if the manufacturing cost is $.40, it would be $0 = $1.60 ($#.004 per page). 


Consequently, the book described above, with manufacturing cost of $1.50 in lots of 1000, $.40 in lots 


= $1.50 = $5.20 (#.013 per page)

4. The sales price should then be fixed at 
three times this unit cost of the book 
if the book is to return cost of publi- 
cation and a small royalty to author. 


DS. If this price, considering the final 
appearance of the book, and the aver— 
age price of scholarly publications 
($.022 per page), is so high as to dis- 
courage sales, it must be cut down. 


These figures indicate that even 
when an edition of 1000 is sold, the in- 
come from sales at the normal price of 
€.022 per page will not pay the cost of 
the edition. But the usual sale of a 
scholarly book is less than 1000 copies. 

Mr. Marshall and Mr. Bean made in- 
dependent studies of the normal size of an 
edition of a book written by a scholar for 
Sscwoblars:. Mr. Bean thinks that the aver- 
age first-year sale of a research book is 
between 500 and 600 copies; the average 
first-year sale of books published by uni- 
versity presses between 350 to 600 copies; 
and the ultimate sale from 900 to 1000. 
Mr. Marshall, after studying the histories 
of fifty-nine titles published by learned 
societies between 1925 and 1929, computes" 
the following averages:

These small sales certainly could 
net be Expected to support publication at 
a price per page so nearly normal. Natural- 
ly, the publishing is not self-supporting. 
In fact, the figures show that the expenses 
of manufacture and administration involved 
in the publication of these fifty-nine ti- 
tles ran to $115,000, while the net pro- 
ceeds from sales to apply against these ex- 
penses came only to $41,000 in round num-

bers. The loss was, therefore, $74,000 on 
fifty-nine titles, or $1254 per book. Six- 
ty-four per cent of the money came to these 
publishing projects as a subsidy. This is 
the ratio for publication by the learned 
societies themselves. 

The costs and returns from a typi- 
cal research book are shown in Table II on 
the following page. 

It is to be expected that the 
learned societies would select for publi- 
cation the titles least likely to have a 
wide sale. The general average for scholar- 
ly publication is computed by Mr. Bean to 
stand on a somewhat different level. He 
calculates that the proportion of publica- 
tion cost met by subsidy is 35%. 

It can be concluded that under 
present publishing practices, a sale of 
600 copies will bring in 66% of the cost 
of publication; a sale of 200 copies will 
bring in 33% of the cost of publication; 
and that no book can be expected to get the 
publisher out of the red until after sales 
have passed well beyond the 1000 mark. 

Mr. Cheney's estimates of average 
sales in commercial publishing (which in- 
cludes some scholarly publishing) confirm 
these conclusions. Mr. Cheney finds that 
58% of all fiction titles sell over 3000 
copies, and 19% of all non-fiction, titles 
sell over this amount. Of fiction titles 


the following distribution is normal: 
9 books in 10 sell over 1,000

Thus, everything points to ~ the 
marked difference between scholarly and 
commercial publishing economy, because of 
the lack of a wide market for the tools 
and products of research scholarship. 


The Volume of Scholarly Publishing 
Mr. Bean has gathered figures which 


make it possible to put the quantity of 
scholarly book and periodical publishing 
in its financial perspective. The number 
Oi Mm he retin prambedsDOOKS Im Vexi silence 
has been estimated at twenty-four million 
tTioles, "Mr. hichardson of the Library of 
Congress thinks there are eight million of 
these in American libraries. Every year 
approximately 150,000 new titles appear, 
about half of which possess some academic 
interest. Ten thousand of the 150,000 new 
books are published in America, and of 
these possibly one-half possess an element 
of interest to the scholar. But the num— 
ber of works of pure research scholarship 
(including materials and tools of research) 
iS mpl LOSS wee wads, / Wome Os Wels 
American books accessioned by the Library 


of Congress in 1927 shows that in that 
year only 1119 books were published for re- 
search scholars. This count excluded the 
many popularization textbooks and books of 
applied science. 

There are about 20,000 periodicals, 
including newspapers, issued in the United 
States, and of these, according to Mr. 
Bean's calculations, 291 are important re- 
search journals issued by scholars for 
scholars. The output of the total publish— 
ing business in America, according to the 
census of manufacturing, runs to two and a 
haliGe bilson dollars sal year. — bookeand 
pamphlet publishing is conducted at a cost 
of two hundred million dollars. Bucy the 
cost of publishing these 1119 research 
books and 291 research journals is estimat-— 
ed by Mr. Bean at approximately six million 
dollars a year--three and a half million 
LOrEpOoks, sand twowandea haln million for 
journals. Only 1 7/10% of the money spent 
for book and pamphlet publishing goes to 
publish research books and pamphlets. The 
cost of publishing for research scholars 
is only 1/4% of the publishing budget of

the country. It is, therefore, inevitable 
that the main technical and business .de- 
velopments in publishing should follow 
other needs than those of research scholar- 
ship. 

Nevertheless, the scholars are in 
@ position to control their own part of the 
industry, for the funds for scholarly pub- 
lishing are drawn almost exclusively from 
the scholars themselves, being paid direct- 
ly or indirectly by the educational insti- 
LuibLons of thevcountry,. olLxty—fivie per 
cent of the money received for the sale of 
research journals comes from the libraries 
together with the members of the societies 
who are for the most part salaried by the 
educational institutions. But the money 
received from sales does not defray the 
whole cost. In scholarly book publishing, 
35% of the money is received in the form of 
subsidies which are in some cases paid di- 
rectly by the institutions, in other cases 
by authors who are salaried by institu- 
GLONS . 

Here are two great enterprises: 
the publishing trade with an annual budget 
of two and one-half billion dollars, and 
the colleges and universities with an an- 
nual budget of five or six hundred million. 
Their interests overlap in the small item

research publishing. Organized scholarship 
can, if it will, bring this area completely 
under its own control. He who pays the pi- 
per Can call the tune. 


The Scholarly Market 

There are no adequate statistics on 
library expenditures for research books, 
but a few figures are available to indicate 
the scale of library purchasing operations. 
The United States Office of Education re- 
ports that the total annual expenditure for 
books, pamphlets, and periodicals reported 
by public, school, college, and other 1i- 
braries (totaling 5803 libraries) in 1929 
was sixteen million dollars, of which al- 
most fourteen million was spent for books 
published in America.' In OSI Lainey, 
book-purchasing power was nineteen million 
dollars.? Most of this money is undoubted- 
ly spent on books of little or no scholarly 
interest. Mr. James Thayer Gerould has 
kept records of the sums spent for acquisi- 
tions by forty of the larger university 
and college libraries. His figures, round- 
ed out to thousands of dollars, stand asin 
Table III for the year 1930-31.

PUBLISHING AND LIBRARY COSTS: 


of the largest reference libraries in the 
country, such as the Library of Congress, 
the New York Public Library, or the John 
Cnerar widprary . 

If each of these forty libraries 
buys every one of the research books (1119) 
published in a given year, and subscribes 
to all of the important research periodi- 
cals (291), the total amount carried on 
each budget for the support of American 
scholarly publishing is only $6350 per li- 
brary, or a total of $254,000 toward the 
six-million-dollar publication bill. 

The smaller university libraries 
and the medium or larger college libraries 
must, therefore, be reckoned as the main 
contributors to American scholarly publish- 
ing. Mr. Bean estimates that 975 such li- 
braries are in the market for research 
books. A careful study of the budgets of 
about 200 of these smaller libraries has 
been made by Professor Randall of the Uni- 
versity of Chicago.10 His findings show 
that 205 college libraries spend every year 
for books $964,000; the average amount an- 
nually devoted to book purchase is $3900; 
the average number of books added to the 
library is 1500 titles per year. Mr. Ran- 
dall thinks there are 600 libraries of this 
class. These studies suggest the conclu- 
sion that the lesser college libraries may 
be spending as much as three to four mil- 
lion dollars a year, but that the smaller 
colleges are often unable to provide ade- 
quate library facilities for instruction of 
students, and hence have little margin to 
be used in helping to finance the reproduc- 
tion of research material. 

Aside from the college libraries, 
there are many agencies which in special 
fields may help to defray the costs of 
scholarly publishing with their purchasing 
power. Mr. Franklin F. Holbrook!s study,tt 
compiled under the direction of the Joint 
Committee on Materials for Research, lists 
458 agencies of which only a small propor- 
Plomeare college dibraries, and of which 
many are active in acquiring research ma-— 
terials. Historical societies, law libra- 
ries, and special libraries of all kinds 
round out the institutional market for re- 
search publications. 


THE BOOK Zi 


Aside from the libraries of insti- 
tutions, there is a market for scholarly 
publications among the scholars themselves. 
The Association of University Presses main- 
tains cooperatively on addressograph plates 
an educational directory of 67,000 names, 
distributed about as follows:

67,051 


These lists are used by the various uni- 
versity presses in circularizing announce- 
ments of books. Presumably they consti- 
tute the active market list. Fifty great 
university and college libraries, a thou- 
sand small ones, several hundred other in= 
Sta tuulons,, and 67,000 scholars=—such is 

the market for scholarly publishing in Amer- 


ica. it is here that the 200 to 600 copies 
of the scholars! research books find their 
sale. 


Library Costs 

The publishing cost and purchase 
price of the book are not the heaviest ex- 
penses that have to be met in making it 
available toa scholar! inva ai bracy. sid 
brary finances must be given a place in the 
total picture, not only because the libra- 
ry is the agency through which the educa- 
tional institutions pay 65% of the sales 
revenue, or 42% of the publishing bill, but 
also because the different methods of re- 
producing materials fit differently into 
the scheme of library finances. 

The money spent by libraries for 
acquisitions is only a small part of the 
cost of maintaining the library system. 
The costs of putting books on the shelves, 
administering them, and housing them are 
greater than the costs of acquiring them. 

The cost analysis of library admin-— 
istration is a disputed field, in which 
the files of the Library Journal report a 
prolonged controversy. The most active 
work in cost analysis has been applied to 
the study of cataloguing cost—-the cost of

putting the book on the shelves. The fig- 
ures which seem best attested are those of 
the University of Californias}. 72" per 
book.: Mr. Paul North Rice, a specialist in 
cooperative cataloguing, thinks that the 
real cost of putting a book on the shelves 
is between $1.50 and $2.00 per volume. Fig- 
ures collected by the government show that 
university libraries spend from 50% to 72% 
or thele funds for other than "acquisition 
purposes. Cornell spends 50%, Yale spends 
72%; the normal amount is about 66%. 

Costs of administration are likely 
to be unusually high when the material 
cared for is not in normal book form. Man- 
uscript and pamphlet collections and col- 
lections of ephemera are often made by li- 
braries without the use of mucn purchase 
money, their cost being principally admin- 
istrative. 

The capital cost of housing a li- 
brary is net included in' this fieure, since 
land and buildings are not often paid for 
out of current funds. The Cleveland Pub- 
ivewlibrary, wauch pays for ics main bunld— 
ing out of revenue, finds that interest and 
twenty-five-year amortization on a four- 
million-dollar building, for which land was 
donated, take up 39% of the money, leaving 
61% for book purchase and administration. 
If the cost of the land had been charged 
to the library, the percentage of revenue 
devoted to housing would have been nearer 
to 75%. The New York Public Library main- 
tains an enormous investment in land and

increasing quantities of material and num- 
bers of readers may call for the doubling 
of the plant every twenty years, and the 
housing cost may be more than double the 
administrative cost, or four times the cost 
of purchasing books. If a book costs $1.00, 
such a library must spend $2.00 to adminis- 
ter it and $4.00 to house it. A person who 
gives a book to a library under these con- 
ditions is really putting the library to an 
expense that may be six times the value of 
hispeuit. That athis heusine icostacanniors 
be dismissed into the remote future but 
must be accepted as a normal element in li- 
brary financing, is indicated in Mr. Ran- 
dall's study of ninety-four college libra- 
ries. He found that forty-eight of these 
will be filled in ten years, and twenty- 
five within a five-year period. Out of 128 
library buildings, sixty-four report either 











that they are already beyond their working 
capacities so far as stack space as con— 
cerned, or that they will be beyond them 
within ten years. 

What is a normal cost-per-book for 
library buildings? It is often figured 
very roughly at $1.00 per volume; that is 
to say, a million dollars will buy a build- 
ing to house a million volumes. But stack 
room is much cheaper than the building as 
a whole. The president of Snead and Com— 
pany, specialists in library shelving prob- 
lems, estimates the following: 


On the basis of present 
'prices, library buildings cammbes plu 
UD at.a costuof whromes 20mbo e250 
per cubic foot. Therstackipor ticnior 
a building without the stacks would 
probably cost from one-third to one- 
half of this figure. The equipment 
of the stack room would cost from 
$.30 to $.40 per cubic foot. In 
figuring stack Koon, a Ligure tor 
about two and one-half volumes per 
cubic foot is approximately correct. 


According to these figures, the 
cost of stack room per book would vary from 
€.062 to $.10, but the cost of equipment 
in the stack room would increase this by an 
amount anywhere from $.12 to $.16 per book. 


The total cost per volume stands, therefore, — 


between $.18 and $.26 for stack room only. 
The difference between this figure and the 
"dollar-a-volume" estimate is accounted for 
by the requirements of space for adminis- 
tration, reading, and study. 

Just as the manuscript or pamphlet 
collections cause an abnormally high admin- 
istration cost, so newspaper collections 
cause an extraordinary housing charge. 
Shelving alone costs $1.00 per newspaper 
volume, and the cubie: Toctage or stack 
space needed with the shelving runs this 
cost up to $2.00 or $3.00 per volume. This 
fact has an important bearing on the prob- 
lem of preserving newspaper files, for it 
may be necessary to choose among preserving 
the existing paper stock, making photo- 
lithographic copies in reduced size on per-— 
manent paper, or making microcopies on film 
or glass. By reducing the size of the news- 
paper one-half, housing costs can be cut 
three-fourths or even more. Another point
