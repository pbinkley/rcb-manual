CHAPTER V 


THE TYPESCRIPT BOOK OR MEMORANDUM: REPRODUCTION TECHNIQUES 


I. Carbon Paper Copying 
Carbon paper offers one of the old- 


est and cheapest means of multiplying type- 
script in a very few copies. It is con- 
stantly used for thesis work. With ordi- 
nary skill and an ordinary typewriter, two 
carbons can be made with high legibility 
and at a maximum price of $.05 per page per 
extra carbon. The number of legible copies 
can be increased by increasing the force of 
the typewriter stroke or diminishing the 
thickness of the paper. The Electromatic 
typewriter, which uses electric power in 
making the impression, exhibits great effi- 
ciencies here. The following table indi- 
cates the number of carbons that can be 
made with one typing and the corresponding 
weights of carbon paper and copy paper. 


gle page, are those of the paper on which 
the fair copy is made; the running costs 
are those incurred in producing additional 
carbons. 

For purposes of convenience in es- 
timating composition costs for ordinary 
typing of manuscripts, a normal cost has 
been estimated on the basis of labor at 
#.40 per hour, paper for the fair copy typ- 
ing at $1.25 per 1000 sheets, onionskin at 
$2.50 per 1000 sheets, and carbon paper at 
$2.50 per 100 sheets. Quotations received 
by the Joint Committee show that prices 
and costs are highly variable, as indicat- 
ed by Table XIII on the following page. 

A normal cost may be taken as $.40 
per 1000 words and an additional charge of 
$.02 1/2 per page per extra carbon, with

the number of carbon 
made into typescript books is set by the 
paper. A paper thin enough to receive with 
fair legibility the seventh copy from an 
ordinary typewriter, or the twenty-fifth 
from an Electromatic, would be too thin for 
book use. 

Of the two elements of first cost, 
the composition costs are the labor costs 
of the fair copy typing; the area costs, 
which vary with the number of pages and 
hence with the number of words put onasin-

the usual 20% discount given on materials 
for manuscripts of over 10,000 words and 
no charge for the materials required to 
produce the fair copy and the first carbon. 
In both cases the format chosen is the 
usual 300-word page of double-spaced pica 
typescript. 

Before the technological limit of 
carbon paper copying is reached, the border 
is crossed to the field of the hectograph. 


II. The Hectograph Process 

In this report the term hectograph- 
ing is used to designate any process by 
which approximately 100 to 150 copies of a 
document may be reproduced in methyl-violet

written or typed in methyl violet dye 


dye from a single master sheet. 


a) Gelatin Hectograph Process 
When a sheet of paper (which we 


will call a master sheet) bearing a text 

nS 
pressed down upon a gelatin surface, the 
methyl-violet image transfers itself to 

the gelatin. If fresh sheets of paper are 
then successively pressed against the gela- 
tin, the methyl-violet image transfers it- 
Sclim=uo them. Tis a number of copies of 
the original are produced. 

Equipment for the gelatin process 
ranges from the little gelatin pan, on 
which the menu of the thirty-five cent 
lunch restaurant is made, to a power-run 
machine with a rotary drum resembling the 
mimeograph. The Ditto, the Speedograph, 
the Vivid Duplicator, and the Standard Ro- 
tary Duplicator are among the best-known 
gelatin process machines. They vary in 
price from $15.00 for a flat-bed machine to 
$475.00 for a power-operated rotary one. 
The gelatin for the rotary models is furn- 
Wened in the form of films 9".x 15" in size, 
which are fastened to the drum of the ma- 
chine as stencils are fastened on the mimeo- 








graph cylinder; the larger, flat-bed equip- 
ment employs a roll with a cloth or fiber 
backing, 9" to 18" wide and about 15! long. 


b) Liquid Hectograph Process 
A second type of hectograph equip- 


ment dispenses with the gelatin. A piece 
of hectograph carbon paper is placed be- 
hind the master sheet, with the carbon side 
toward the master paper while the text is 
being written or typed. A reversed carbon 
image is thus produced on the back of the 
master sheet. The master sheet is fastened 
to the cylinder of the machine and the copy 
is reproduced by bringing the side bearing 
the carbon image in contact with fresh 
sheets of paper, which are moistened witha 
special duplicating fluid as they are fed 
into the machine. 

There are three kinds of liquid 
process equipment: the Ormig (Figure XX), 
made in Germany and sold for $160.00 to 
$475.00; the Standard New Process Duplica- 
tor (Figure XXI), which sells for $187.50 
to $440.00; and the Ditto Liquid Duplica- 
tor, fixed at $200.00 for the hand-run 
model and $265.00 for the power-run ma- 
chine. 


a4 METHODS OF REPRODUCING RESEARCH MATERIALS 


The Joint Committee has experiment- 
ed with both the liquid process and the 
gelatin machines. The result of extensive 
comparison in the practical working of the 
two processes is definitely in favor of the 
liquid process as against the gelatin for 
the following reasons: 


1) Quality of Product: In the gela- 
tin method, copies in the same run are 
never uniform in shade and are always light- 
er than the corresponding copies done by 
the liquid process. The age, condition, 
and preparation of the gelatin have a much 
more important effect on the quality of the 
copies done by the gelatin method than do 
the same factors of the carbon in the liq- 
uid process. 


2) Permanence: Copies produced by 
the liquid process are more permanent than 
those produced by the gelatin method, be- 
cause the liquid practically dyes the ink 
into the fibers of the paper, while the 
gelatin merely deposits the dye on the sur- 
face of the paper. 


3) Speed: The rotary liquid machine 
is capable of producing many more copies 
per minute than the flat-bed or rotary gel- 
atin equipment. The time for preparing for 
the gelatin run is almost equal to the ac- 
tual running time of the liquid machine. 


4) Simplicity of Operation: With the 
liquid method, only three operations are 


necessary-—-typing the original, clipping it 
in place, and turning the handle, or press- 
ing the foot pedal, to produce the copies. 
The gelatin machine requires much more 
preparation. 


5) Reprint Economies: Reprints from 
the original master sheet are feasible with 


the liquid process (but not recommended for 
a very long run); they are impossible with 
the gelatin method. 


6) Gelatin Supply: It is necessary 
to have on hand as many fresh gelatin films 
as there are master sheets to be run in 
close succession, for a used film must be 
allowed to stand from six to twenty-four 
hours before the dye is sufficiently ab- 
sorbed and dissipated to allow a new master 
image to be imposed upon it. If a 100-page 


document were to be hectographed by the gel- 
atin process in a single day, a supply of 
at least fifty films would be necessary. 

The variable elements in the gela- 
tin process are so much greater than the 
variables in the liquid process that exact 
cost comparisons are unreliable. There are 
no decisive reasons for expecting the gela- 
tin process to operate at a substantially 
lower cost than the liquid method. 

The prices of special supplies for 
the gelatin process are listed below. Where 
the gelatin process equipment is already 
available, it can be used; but the calcula- 
tion of the place of hectographing in the 
reproduction of typescript is based on the 
use of the liquid process.

Cost Analysis of Hectographing: (a) Com- 


position and Running Costs 
Composition and running costs for i 
hectographing require little analysis. Fair 
and format typings are merged, and composi- 
tion costs for typing may be figured at 
the normal typing rates. Labor, copy pa- 
per, and liquid charges comprise the run- 
ning costs. Liquid for the hectograph 
process is sold for $2.50 to $3.50 per 
gallon. A gallon will serve to moisten at 
least 6,000 sheets of copy paper or as 
many as 10,000 sheets; it makes no differ- 
ence whether theseare runas2e5 copies each e 
of 240 separate pages of text, or 150 cop- 
jes each of 40 different masters. The 
highly calendered copy paper required for 
the best results may be purchased for $1.65 4 
in quantities of 1000 sheets, with reduc-— 
tions in.price starting at 10,000 sheets. 
For less attractive but perfectly legible 
work, ordinary bond paper at a slightly 
lower price per 1000 sheets is satisfacto- 
ry, but as it absorbs more fluid than the 
regular copy paper it is really not econom- 
iealy, 








(b) Area Costs and Legibility 
Area costs are those of the master 


sheets ($1.50 to $3.00 per 1000 sheets) 
and the hectograph carbon paper ($.04 to 
$.06 per sheet in quantities of 100). These

costs are the ones most subject to varia- 
tion and they are the most important on ac- 
count of their relationship to legibility. 
If a saving in area costs is attempted by 
using single rather than double-spaced type- 
script to get more words on the master 
sheet, the legibility of the product dimin- 
ishes accordingly, but a more important 
consideration is the efficient use of the 
hectograph carbon paper. For the most leg- 
ible results carbon paper should be used 
only once. Of course if the typewriter is 
set for double-spacing, the carbon may be 
used the second time with no decrease in 
legibility by typing between the lines of 
PNCw irs be CODY. Carbon paper may be used 
as many as three times, but with greatly 
decreasing contrast and sharpness of defi- 
nition in the letters produced. The fol- 
lowing summary of the cost of the dye in 
relation to legibility may be made: 


a) High contrast (first use) 
$.04 to $.06 per page; average $.045 
b) Medium contrast (second use) 
$.02 to $.03 per page; average $.0225 
c) Low contrast (third use) 
$.01 to $.01 1/2 per page; average $.015 


Length of run is also a factor in 
determining the legibility of hectographed 
matter: the first few gelatin copies are 
brighter than the later ones, the diminish- 
ing contrast being due to the gradual ex- 
haustion of the supply of dye; with the 
liquid process the decrease in legibility 
begins after the 100 or 150 mark is reached. 
This diminution in contrast may be regu- 
lated somewhat, however, as the operation 
of the liquid process machines may be modi- 


fied to yield a few more brilliant copies 
or a greater number of paler ones, and as 
the carbon papers are sold in various 
grades--i.e., hard, medium, and soft-- 
adapted for runs of varying length. 

The efficiency range of the hecto- 
graph begins with the five or six copies 
where it crosses the carbon paper technique 
and runs up toward 200. Bound in place 
here are four samples of hectograph work. 
They are numbered to indicate their place 
in the run. Figure XXII is made with the 
gelatin process; note that the letters are 
smoother and more blurred than those made 
by the liquid process. Figures XXIIIa and 
XXIIIb are made with the Standard New Proc- 
ess Duplicator, one page being taken from 
an early place in a run, the other being 
selected from a later part of the run. A 
comparison of these two pages will show the 
difference in legibility of work taken from 
two different places in runs. Figure XXIV 
is made with the Ormig liquid duplicator. 
By comparing these four sample pages, the 
reader will be able to note the variations 
between the products of the gelatin and 
liquid hectograph processes, and to esti- 
mate the curve of diminishing legibility as 
the number of copies taken from the master 
sheet increases. 

The table below shows the cost of 
hectographing by the liquid process a book 
of) 100,000 words, "with typing figuredy at 
$.50 per hour, labor for running the dupli- 
cating machine figured at $.40 an hour, a 
fresh sheet of carbon used for each master 
sheet, and hectograph copy paper used for 
the run. The best possible hectographed 
product will result.

46 METHODS OF REPRODUCING RESEARCH MATERIALS 





c) Application of Hectographing to the 


Problems of Scholarship 
When compared with the average quo- 


tation for typing, these figures indicate 
that the hectograph will distribute the 
documents of internal circulation among 
scholars at prices so nearly within the 
range of those that authors are accustomed 
to assume in connection with the prepara- 
tion of their typescript manuscripts, that 
the cost of giving a limited distribution 
in hectographed form could be assumed by 
the writers themselves with little more 
trouble than they now take in distributing 
reprints of their articles from periodicals. 

An experiment in the use of this 
method as a means of reproducing doctoral 
dissertations has been sponsored by the 
Joint Committee. Dr. Stanton Davis of the 
Case School of Applied Science in Cleve- 
land prepared by the liquid hectograph 
process an edition of fifty of a 350-page 
dissértation, "Pennsylvania Politics, 1660— 
Bo, 2b es unit cost of $1.05, Additional 
expenses for binding amounted to $32.50, 
and mailing to eighteen libraries cost

A few copies are available for sale at the 
Western Reserve University Bookstore at 
$3.00 (paper binding) and $3.75 (cloth 
binding). The hectograph costs, exclusive 
Ce viaiGi MNeane Maia | orl sed sd omer 
fifty were $47.10 more than the cost for a 
typescript copy and one carbon. 


The hectograph process is probably 
more serviceable, however, as a means of 
distributing the type of material that would 
otherwise be printed in pamphlet form or as 
articles in periodicals. No binding costs 
other than simple wire stapling need inter- 
vene to increase the charge upon the author; 
hectographed memoranda up to twenty or 
thirty pages in length would probably find 
their place of storage in a vertical file, 
An example of this use of the process is 
the reproduction by the Joint Committee of- 
fice of Dr. Robert C. Binkley's thirty— 
four-page memorandum, "New Tools, New Re- 
cruits for the Republic of Letter," ata 
Uni teCoat sols Gen. 

Hectographing is not recommended as 
a means of preserving original source ma- 
terial because of the impermanence of the 
dye, which fades rapidly if exposed to sun- 
light for any length of time. However, the 
kind of monographic work that becomes out 
of date inthirty or forty years may be cir- 
culated in hectographed form without loss 
to scholarship from its impermanence. Ifa 
single standard carbon copy is made while 
typing the hectograph master sheet, this 
copy can be deposited and held for perma- 
nence. 


III. Mimeograph Techniques: Mimeographing 
and Direct-Typing Offset Printing 

The mimeograph process multiplies 
typescript by means of a stencil printing 
surface on which the letters of the format 
copy are cut by the typewriter. The sten- 
cil is fastened on a cylinder.) wandiac 
sheets of paper are fed into the machine an 
impression is produced on the copy paper by 
the squeezing of ink through the abraded 
portions of the stencil. The equipment 
ranges in price from $30.00 to $375. 000for 
a hand-run machine and from $255.00 to 
$450.00 for an electrically operated model 
with an automatic feed. The preparation 
of the printing surface is almost as simple 
as ordinary typewriting, and the machine 
can be operated by the lowliest office boy, 
so that although this form of duplicating 
is' commercialized by service agencies, ale 
most every office of any size possesses a 
mimeograph of its own. Both costs and 
prices, therefore, must be analyzed for 
mimeograph work. 

The rotaprint and multilith have 
been briefly mentioned in Chapter III in 











REPRODUCTION TECHNIQUES

connection with the discussion of photo- 
offset as a reprinting method. The press 
plates for reprinting are, of course, pre- 
pared photographically. But there is an 
alternative way of putting on such plates 
the format copy of the text to be repro- 
duced: the metal sheets that are used on 
these small offset presses can be inserted 
in a typewriter as if they were sheets of 
paper, to receive typescript directly. The 
making of typescript books from press 
plates prepared in this manner is called 
"direct-typing" offset, as compared with 
photo-offset. Direct-typing offset is much 
less common than photo-offset but also much 
cheaper, and it is, therefore, worthy of 
consideration by any institution possess-— 
ing sufficient resources to purchase a ro- 
taprint or a multilith for either commer- 
cial or non-commercial use. For the bene- 
fit of owmers and non-owners, both costs and 
prices will be quoted. 

From the standpoint of cost be- 
havior, mimeographing and direct-—typing 
offset are very closely related. They will, 
therefore, be referred to henceforth in 
this report as the "mimeograph" techniques, 
and their costs will be analyzed together. 


Composition Cost Analysis 
It will be seen that the cost of 


the printing surface (or the area cost) for 
the mimeograph processes, whether of stencil 
or metal sheet, is considerably more than 
the cost of the printing surface used with 
the hectograph, and that it differs from 
ordinary paper in its physical character. 
There is, therefore, a greater likelihood 
in mimeographing than in hectographing that 
there will be three typing processes. The 
author will have a fair copy made from his 
draft copy, and then a format typing will 
be necessary to transfer the text to the 
metal sheet or stencil. This is not tech- 
nologically necessary, for the typist could 
work directly from a draft copy to a mimeo- 
graph stencil; but this extra format typing 
is so often done that most of the quota- 
tions presuppose it. 

Precisely because the area cost is 
Significant in mimeographing, the problem 
of format must be studied; for it becomes 
important to lay down as much as possible 
on a given area, without unduly sacrificing 
legibility and beauty. But it goes with- 
out saying that any format differing from 


- 


the usual one-column, six-line-to-the-inch, 
pica or elite typescript format will be 
more expensive to prepare. In estimating 
the average mimeographing costs, therefore, 
format typing will be charged at $.80 per 
1000 words in order to provide for the 
slowing up that is necessary to produce an 
unusual typescript page. The specifica- 
tions for satisfactory mimeograph formats 
will be discussed in connection with area 
costs. 


Area Costs and Format 

Mimeograph stencils are of five 
kinds and are sold in two standard sizes, 
8 1/2" x Ti"and 8 1/2" x 140.9 The prices 
as standardized in the trade are given be- 
low. Bootleg dealers sometimes sell sten- 
cils manufactured in violation of patent 
rights at half these prices. The patent 
rights will expire within the next decade, 
but by that time technology may have moved 
far beyond the mimeograph. Large govern- 
ment orders are filled at discounts up to 
50% in competitive bidding.

not exceeding 500. It cannot be saved, and 
more care is needed to produce a good copy 
with the wax stencil than with the mimeo- 
type stencil. A sample of work done on a 
wax stencil is seen in Figure XXVII. The 
Cellotype stencil, a white stencil with a 
carbon back, is used when very high visi- 
bility is desired; the dermatype, a wet 
process stencil, is seldom used and is al- 
most obsolete; the mimeotype stencil, re- 
ferred to as the "universal stencil," is 
used for every purpose except the photo- 
graphic work. The dermaprint stencil has 
been discussed at length in Chapter III. 
There are two kinds of metal sheets 
that can be used directly in the typewrit- 
er--the rotaplate:-and the multilith metal 
sheet. The claim is made that the multi- 
lith sheet can be used over again for about 
three times; the rotaprint people say that 


they have not found any process whereby the 
rotaplate can be used over again with sat-— 
isfactory results.

FIGURE XXV 


Direct typing on a Rotaplate is done by using either 
a special Rotaprint carbon paper in the typewriter, a 
Rotaprint "G" ribbon, or a Royal Photo-offset typewriter 
using carbon ribbon which does not require any preparatory 
treatment, is placed in the typewriter the same as a sheet 
of paper. In the typing, a very light impression against 
the Rotaplate should be made; a hard platen that will give 
a sharp outline of the characters is best. Errors are cor- 
rected in the usual manner. 

When the typing is done, the sheet is dusted with a 
special Rotaprint powder. A small amount of liquid solu- 
tion is then poured on the sheet and spread over the sur- 
face with a piece ef cotton. The excess fluid is wiped 
off, leaving a thin coating on the surface. The Rotaplate 
is now ready to be used on the machine. It can be filed 
indefinitely. 

One Rotaplate will make 25,000 or more copies. The 
Rotaplate used for this work costs $.20. 

This sample page of direct typing Rotaprint work can 
be compared with Figure XXVI, which illustrates direct 


typing on a Multilith machine.

FIGURE XXVI 


This sample page demonstrates Multilith direct typing. MThis 
page was produced by direct typing on a Multilith Duplex plate, 
which requires no preparation to receive the image. A special 
carbon typewriter ribbon was then used and the typing was done in 
the usual manner. The plate was then run off on the Model 1200 
Multilith, at the speed of approximately 5,000 impressions per hour. 


The cost of the Duplex plate was $.25, but since it is possible 
to use both sides of the plate the cost is reduced to $.12¢ per image. 
The solutions necessary to prepare the plate for running were $.023 
bringing the total cost of the printing surface to $.15 an image in 
this form. 


The surface of the duplex plate is also receptive to crayon, 
ink. and regular fabric typewriter ribbons of the proper inking. 
The surface of this plate can be used only once to each side. It is 
possible to obtain five to ten thousand impressions from the duplex 
plate. 


The Multilith Zine plate, which has a grain on only one side, 
is also receptive to the above mentioned methods of direct work, after 
being treated with a solution of Deoxit. 


The cost of the zinc plate is $.35, but the surface of this 
plate can be cleaned, and re-employed three or four times- The plate 
is cleaned by applying a solution of Blankrolla to the surface to 
wipe out the first image. It is then resensitized with a solution 
of Deoxit. 


The life of the Multilith zinc plate direct image is from five to 
ten thousand impressions, but by the application of a solution called 
intensifier it can be extended from five to ten thousand impressions.

FIGURE XXVIII 


This is a sample page done with micro- 
elite type. In this format, 800 words are 
contained on one page. Compare this figure 
with Figure YXVII, containing 400 words per 
page and using special interlinear spacing. 

To mimeograph a bxok of 100,000 werds 
in this format would mean tremendous savings 
in stencil cost and paper east. Composition 
cost would, of course, be no less, and might 
even be somewhat more expensive, due to the 
two-column arrangement. 

The inference, of course. is ebvious: 
there is a close tieup between cost and leg- 
ibility. The more money that is put into a 
job, the more likely it is that the result- 
ing product will have greater legibility and 
be more pleasing to the eve. This brings up 
the problem of how we are to determine the 
exact point at which cost. legibility. and 
beauty of appearance come together in the 
best balance. This problem has not yet re- 
ceived its final analysis. It is known. 
however. that beyond a certain point there 
is no need to spend more money for increased 
legibility. because the factor of legibility 
has already reached its maximam point. and a 
more expensive format would add to nothing 
except, perhaps, the printer's profit. 

In order to exhibit as manv as possible 
of the different varieties of the mimeograph 
process, sample pages have been run off on 
various paper stocks from Rotaprint and lMul- 
tilith metal sheets, and from Vimeotvpe and 
wax stencils. The reader mst make all-w- 
ance for the fact that paper stocks, formats 
and processes are all on display, and mst 
decide for himself which differences in the 
sample pages are due to formt variahles. 
which to paper, and which to the reproduc- 
tion methods. , F 

The mimeograph process multiplies type- 
script by means of a stencil printing sur- 
face 9n which the letters of the format copy 
are cut by the typewriter; the stencil is 
fastened on a cylinder. and as sheets of pa- 
pae are fed into the machine. an impression 
is produced on the copy paper by the squeez- 
ing of ink threugh the abraded pertions of 
the stencil, Mimeograph equinment ranges in 
price from $30,00 te $375.00 fer hand-run 
models, and from $255.00 te $45f.00 for the 
electrically operated models with automatic 


feed. The preparation of the printing sur- 
face is almost as simple as ordinary tvpe- 
writing, so that, although this form of dup- 
lication is commereially available through 
service agencies, almost every office of any 
size possesses its own Mimeograph machine. 

The Rotaprint and the Maltilith have 
been mentioned in connection with the dis- 
cussion of photo-offset as a reprinting 
method. The press plates for reprinting are 
prepared ochotegravhically, of eourse, but 
there is an alternative way of putting on 
such plates the format cooy of the text to 
be repr-duced. The metal sheets that are 
used on these small cffset presses can he 
inserted in a tvoewriter as if they were 
sieets of paper, to receive typescript di- 
rectly. The making of typescript books from 
press plates prepared in this manner may 
perhaps be called 'direct tvoing" offset, as 
compzred with photo-offset. It is much less 
common than photo-offset, tut also much less 
expensive, and it is therefore worthy of con- 
sideration by any institution possessing suf- 
ficient resources to purchase a Rotaprint or 
& Maltilitn for either commercial or non- 
commercial use. 

From the stand »oint of cost behaviour, 
mimeograpning and direct typing offset are 
very closely related. Thev will therefore 
be referred to in this report as the ''mim- 
eograph'' techniques, and their costs will 
be analyzed together. 

This is a sample page done with micro- 
elite type. In this format, 800 words per 
page are accomodated. Compare this figure 
with Figure "XVII. containing 400 words per 
page and using special interlinear spacing. 

To mimeograph a book of 100,000 words 
in this format would mean tremendous sovings 
in stencil cost and paper cost. Composition 
cost would, of course, be no less, and might 
even be somewhat more expensive, due to the 
two-celumn arrangement. 

The inference, of course, is obvious: 
there is a close tieup tetween cost and leg- 
ibility. The more money that is put intoa 
job, the more likely it is that the res »l1t- 
ing product will have grenter legibility and 
be more plevsing to the eye, This brings up 
the oroblem of how we are to determine the 
exact point at which cost, legibility, and

By combining these factors in vari- 
ous ways, there might be constructed over 
fifty different typescript formats. The 
difference in word-carrying capacity be- 
tween the two extremes is very great. A 
hundred thousand words would go on 12% pages 
oo 61/2" x 14" size, elite type, single 
spaced, 6 1/2" lines, narrow-margin format; 
but would require 562 pages of 8 1/2" by 
11" size, pica type, double-spaced, 5" 
lines, and a wide-margin format. 

By a combination of experiment and 
guesswork, the writers have reached the 
conclusion that the formats shown in 
Table XIX are advisable for the number of 
words per page indicated. 


Explanation of Sample Pages and Cost Table 
In order to exhibit as many as pos- 
sible of the different varieties of the 
mimeograph process, the sample pages fol- 
lowing have been run off on mimeograph and 
bond paper of different weights, from rota- 
print and multilith metal sheets and from 
wax and mimeotype stencils (Figures XXV to 
XXVIII). The reader must make allowance 
for the fact that paper stock, format, and 
process are all on display; and he must 
decide for himself which differences in 
the exhibits are due to format variables, 
which to paper, and which to the reproduc-

lines to the inch should be wholly satis-—

cal inches of mimeograph printing surface 
could just as well take forty-five lines

to take the twenty-seven lines that ordi-

The five-lines-—to-the-inch spacing 
would let twelve mimeograph stencils do 
the work of twenty stencils; the four-and- 
one-half—lines-to-the-inch spacing would 
let fourteen stencils do the work of twen-

equipment can be earned, therefore, by the 
economies in cost of stencils in a mimeo- 
graphing job of less than 50,000 words.1 

The cost and prices of mimeograph-

lowing chart. But in order to make the 
comparison of formats very clear, the es-

of the same printing surface, namely, the 
ordinary 8 1/2" x 11" mimeotype stencil,

hypotheses regarding composition cost: 
first, that the format copy is typed di- 
rectly from the draft copy without an in- 
tervening fair copy; and second, that the 
fair copy is made on paper and then re- 
typed as format copy on the mimeograph 
stencil. Labor for operating the duplicat 
ing machine is estimated at $.40 per hour. 
The choice of format would control a vari- 
ation in area costs of 350% from the mini- 


mum and a corresponding variation in run- 
ning costs. (See Table XX on the follow- 
ing page.) 

These are costs based on average 
estimates for office work; prices vary 
greatly from this calculated cost basis. 
The comparison of cost and price, i.e., of 
work done in an office and work sent out, 
can be seen in one instance in the compari- 
son as shown in Table XXI, page 52.

REPRODUCTION TECHNIQUES 53 


IV. Photo-Offset from Typescript 
The photo-offset technique has al- 


ready been described in connection with the 
reprinting of books out of print. The same 
technique is available for the reproduc- 
tion of typescript. Why should it be used, 
however, when typescript can be multiplied 
without an intervening photographic proc- 
ess? 

The difference between the direct 
and indirect making of a typescript print- 
ing surface can be illustrated in compar- 
ing the two possible ways of using the 
multilith. By the first method the typist 
takes a metal sheet, coats it with a prepa- 
ratory solution, puts it into her typewrit- 
er exactly as if it were a piece of paper, 
bypes the text on it, clips it to the drum 
of the multilith and reproduces it. By the 
second method the typist makes a copy with 
a strong black ribbon on paper. An opera- 
tor photographs this typescript page, se- 
curing a negative on film or paper--in this 
case usually paper. Then the photographic 
negative is laid on the metal, which has 
meanwhile been sensitized, and strong arc 
lights burn in the text from the photo- 
graphic negative on to the metal plate. 
Then at last the metal plate is put on the 
drum, and the multiplying of copies can be- 
gin. The additional work increases not 
only the labor time but also the labor 
rate, because the additional photographic 
skill is necessary. Why should the costs 
of all these intermediate steps be borne? 
Why should the area cost be so greatly in- 
creased when the end product is still a 
typescript book? 


Justification for Increased Area Cost 

If the text includes illustrations 
or characters that must be filled in by 
hand, or certain kinds of tabular or chart- 
ed data, the reason for using the photo- 
graphic step is clear. If, however, the 
text is simply typescript and nothing else, 








the justification of the extra cost must be 
found elsewhere. 

There are three reasons for incur- 
ring this additional area cost: first, the 
plates of the larger offset presses are too 
big to be put into the typewriter; second, 
the better photo-offset presses will dis- 
tribute ink more evenly and make finer let- 
ters than the mimeograph techniques (includ- 
ing direct-typing offset) will produce; 
third, the standard typescript relations of 
type size, length of line, interlinear spac-— 
ing, and size of page are not related to 
the normal 10" spacing of library shelving 
in a way that results in the most efficient 
use of page areas and bookshelf footage. 


Photographic Reduction of Typescript: 


(a) Economies in Type Size 
Typescript is wasteful of page 


areas because of the large size of the type. 
Photo-offset permits a photographic reduc- 
tion of typescript in any degree.* There- 
fore, by the photo-offset process a type- 
script can be brought down to the equiva- 
lent of 8- and 10-point type as used in 
books, or to the equivalent of 7-point 
newsprint. A table of equivalents was sug- 
gested in Chapter IV, by which various re- 
ductions of typescript could be correlated 
with corresponding point sizes of book type 
by a photographic process. 

There has been one direct study of 
the legibility of reduced typescript by 
Professor Greene of Michigan. Professor 
Greene came to the conclusion that what he 
called "seven-point typewriter type" (i.e., 
pica typescript reduced to 70% of full size 
so that it laid down fourteen letters to 
the inch instead of ten) was just as legi- 
ble as full-sized pica typescript.® 

The reader should be given an oppor- 
tunity to test this judgment and to compare 
the legibility of typescript in various re- 
ductions with the legibility of book-face 
type. To make the comparison possible, six

areas of four square inches each are filled 
with reading matter (Figure XXIX). The 
first square is filled with text in 10- 
point type, and typescript that will lay 
down the same number of words in the same 
area is set beside it; the second pair of 
squares is filled with pica typescript re- 
duced to 80% of normal size, and with ordi- 
nary printing in 7-point type, which fills 
the same area with the same number of words; 
the third pair of squares shows that pica 
typescript must be reduced to 70% of full 
size to put the same number of words in the 
area that will be put there by ordinary 
newsprint. The reader may judge the com- 
parative legibilities. 

Whatever conclusions the reader may 
draw from these illustrations and from the 
exhibits of standard photo-offset type- 
script formats as to the permissible amount 
of reduction which pica typescript will 
take without sacrifice of legibility, the 
essential fact stands that reduction in 
size of typescript increases very rapidly 
the number of words that can be laid on a 
given page area. While the linear dimen- 
sions of the typescript are falling by an 
arithmetical ratio, the number of words per 
page is increasing by a geometrical ratio. 
This is the same situation that is encoun- 
tered in any photographic reproduction 
process in which a reduction of the size of 
the writing is involved. 


Photographic Reduction of Typescript: 


(b) Length of Line and Economy 
There is an additional feature that 


makes this consideration especially impor- 
tant in the case of typescript, and that is 
the effect of reduction on length of line. 
there is very little reason to\carry outra 
reduction of typescript size if a single 
column of typescript is still to be carried 
on a sheet of paper 8 1/2" x 11", because 
so much of what is gained in the use of 
space by diminishing the type size is sim- 
ply turned over to wider margins. But here 
two possibilities intervene: the reading 
matter may be typed in two or more columns 
and reproduced on the standard typewriter 
size page, or the size of the page itself 
may be reduced to something more nearly re- 
sembling that of an ordinary octavo book. 

But since an octavo page, 6" x 9", 
with lines of maximum length (3.9" for 6- 
to 10-point type, according to Vernon) 








sacrifices 35% of its surface to right- and 
left-hand margins, an 8 1/2" x 11" page, 
with two columns each 3 1/4" wide, which 
sacrifices only 23 1/2% to right- and left— 7 
hand margins, is preferable. The differ- 
ence is increased by the fact that a larger 
side margin usually calls for larger top 
and bottom margins. Since the cost of 
printing surface is an area cost and the | 
margin space costs just as much per square 
inch as the part of the page that is uti- 
lized for text, it is especially important 
in planning an economy format for a photo- 
offset typescript book that the margins 
shall not be made any larger than necessary. — 
It is interesting to note in this connec- 
tion that Edwards Brothers propose, for an 

8 1/2" x 11" page, a two-column format with 
columns 3 1/2" wide, and the Donnelley & 
Sons Company suggests a similar format. 

With these facts in mind, one may 
lay down the conditions under which it may 
be profitable to reproduce typescript by 
photo-offset rather than by the mimeograph 
process: by the increased utilization of 
paper and printing surface owing to reduc- ~~ 
tion in size of type, and the diminution of ~ 
the proportion of area given over to mar- 
gins, the photo-offset process will at some ~ 
point reach a cost figure that will make up 
for some of the additional costs of the 
photographic element in the process. 
for instance, the area cost of making a 
photo-offset page is three times the area 
cost of making a mimeograph page, the area 
cost per word will be the same only if six 
times as much reading matter can be put on 
the photo-offset page.

Specifications for Reproducing the Same 
Book at the Same Cost by Mimeographing and 
by Photo-Offset 

Cost comparisons between photo- 
offset and mimeographing as means of repro- 
ducing typescript are complicated by the 
fact that photo-offset is usually shopwork 
sent out on contract, and, therefore, costs 
to the publisher must be calculated on the 
basis of actual price quotations by firms

mimeograph process is so much a part of of-

and commercial photo-offset quotations. 

A further complication increasing 
the difficulty of cost comparison is the 
fact that any format devised to secure a 
maximum use of the paper surface is likely 
to require a special format typing; the 
fair-copy typing operation cannot so easi- 
ly be merged with the format-copy typing as 
in the processes which use a simpler for- 
mat. In both cases, therefore, the cost of 
a format typing from the fair copy will be 
figured into the estimates made. 

An extra operation required to 
justify the right-hand margin also calls 
for calculation, whether the method used 
should be that of a second format typing 
or the special paper invented by Spielvogel 
(see Chapter IV). The cost of this opera- 
tion will not be figured into the esti- 
mates. 





Taking all of these factors into 
account, it seems that mimeographing 50,000 
words in a format that permits 300 words to 
the 8 1/2" x 11" page would cost about the 
Same as reproducing the same number of 
words by photo-offset in a format that re- 
produces 1786 words to the 8 1/2" x 11" 
page. 

As in all problems of reproducing 
research materials, the rule holds that be- 
tween certain limits an increase in attrac- 
tiveness of text and format accompanies an 
increase in cost. Above the level at which 
photo-offset typescript costs the same as 
mimeographing, there are other photo-offset 
formats available at costs that increase 
until they come to exceed the cost of effi- 
ciency formats in printing. 


Photo-Offset Typescript Format: 
lization of Printing Surface 
In planning formats for the photo- 
offset book there must be considered a 
fixed set of dimensions not those of the 
typewriter page--namely, the dimensions of 
a metal sheet of the offset press. Though 
Commercial quotations often ignore this 
factor, it actually enters into the cost in 
avery material way, for whenever a format 
is so designed that it fails to use the 
full available printing surface of the 
photo-offset metal sheet, energy and materi- 
al are wasted. The sensitizing and prepa- 
ration of the metal sheet are substantially 
the same whether all or merely a part of 
the surface is used; the waste that occurs

when the page is not planned to fit the 
metal sheet has been discussed in Chapter 
III in connection with reprinting. 

The ideal typescript format, from 
the standpoint of printshop efficiency, 
would be based on a page size that would 
divide evenly into the area of one of the 
larger press plates. The plates most com- 
monly in use will take paper sheets of the 
following dimensions:

This consideration is of great im- 
portance in the case of a long run, but if 
only 200 or 300 copies of a book are de- 
sired, the cost of the paper is so slight 
an element in the total cost that paper 
economy may in some cases be sacrificed in 
the interest of printing surface economy. 

The relative importance of econom- 
ies in utilization of metal sheet area and 
economies in utilization of paper is estab- 
lished by the fact that the first is a sav-— 
ing in area cost, the second a saving in 
running cost. The smaller the edition, 
the larger is the proportion of area cost 
and the smaller the proportion of running 
cost, and hence of cost of paper. In the 
small editions—-around 100--the area cost 
so far preponderates over running cost 
that some firms give the same quotation for 
HOONCopLes as ore s0copilesr. In such 
editions wasteful use of paper is 


56 


justified if it will bring equivalent econ- 
omies in the use of the photo-offset metal 
sheet. The exact point at which it will 
cease to pay to waste paper for the sake of 
saving metal sheet printing surface can al- 
ways be calculated by estimating the total 
price of the paper wasted and comparing it 
with the area cost saved. 

What then is an ideal format for 
the photo-offset typescript book? The 
standard octavo printing formats (accord- 
ing to published figures on binding) of 
6" x 9" and 6 1/4" x 9 1/4" are ill adapted 
to offset work because they lead either to 
an undue extent of margin, an undue length 
of line, or an inadequate use of the re- 
ducing power of the photographic process. A 
column of maximum width (3.9") can be 
printed in the 5 1/2") x 8 1/2" page witht 
only 42.4% of the area surrendered to mar- 
gins, but this volume is too small for con- 
venient library shelving. The best format 
for library shelving convenience and low 
margin ratio would be just short of 10" 
high, and the narrowest page that would ac- 
cept two columns would be 7 3/4" wide. Such 
a page would take two columns of minimum 
width (2.9") with 1/2" between them, and 
external margins of about 3/4", The per- 
centage of area given over to margins would 
be about 26%. The book page would have an 
unusual appearance--more nearly square than 
an ordinary octavo page. Yet it would be 
very efficient (Figure XXX). 

Now the curious fact emerges that 
despite all the variety of sizes available 
in photo-offset press, there is none that 
will take without waste of printing sur- 
face al page 9.3/4". =e 773/4".. "Thus the lim 
itations of equipment impose themselves in 
planning a model photo-offset page. 

Planning a photo-offset page is 
more intricate than planning a mimeograph 





page because, while all the variants of 
length of line, interlinear spacing, mar- 
gins, size of type, and number of columns 


are present, there are added the addition- 
al factors of a photographic reduction ra- 
tio and a layout on a photo-offset metal 
sheet. The format copy is typed on one 
size of page, the book appears in another 
size of page. Moreover, while the use of 
book type in planning a page has been made 
the subject of much study, the use of type- 
script with photo-offset has been left to 
rule of thumb. 


METHODS OF REPRODUCING RESEARCH MATERIALS 


To illustrate the planning of a 
photo-offset page, an exercise is here car- 
ried out in calculating a format for a book 
of 50,000 words to meet two different cost 
situations: first, to cost as' much minvau 
edition of 500 as low-cost printing; sec- 
ond, to cost as much in an edition of 500 
as medium-cost mimeographing. By consult- 
ing the tables in Chapter III, it appears 
that an edition of this size, in an "econc= 
my format," can be printed at $365.00 
(6 3/4" x 9 1/2" page size, two columns); 
and the same text, mimeographed in a 400- 
word format, will cost $158.00 (see page5l). 

The question may then be asked, is 
photo-offset as expensive as printing? Is 
it as cheap as mimeographing? The answer 
is-that iteis both, and! thay thescoc ssc. 
pends on the format. The format is itself 
the determinant of legibility, and anyone 
with a typewriter and a supply of paper can 
plan a format that will meet any price 
level from the lowest to the highest. 

The general formula for finding a 
photo-offset format that will reproduce a 
given number of words for a given sum of 
money in an edition of a given size can be 
worked out from data already presented in 
this volume. 

Given N (a number of words) and D 
(a sum of money available), from the in- 
formation in Chapter IV on costs of typing, 
calculate the cost of making a format copy 
of this number of words, which will be D! 
(the composition cost). D minus D! will be 
available for photo-offset work--the area 
and running cost. From the tables in Chap- 
ter III, calculate the number and size of 
photo-offset pages that can be produced in 
the required number of copies for D minus 
D' dollars. Then lay off on these pages 
the desired margins, make a decision on the 
number of columns of print, and conclude 
with the dimensions in inches of space to 
be filled with text. Let L be the length 
of the column, W the width of the column, 

P the number of pages, and C the number of 
columns to a page. 

N/CP is the number of words per 
column. The type of text may lead to the 
conclusion that the number of keystrokes 
per word is greater or smaller than six, 
but six can be taken as a good average. To ~ 
keep the formula perfectly general, however, 
let K be the number of keystrokes per word 
(including allowance for inter-word spacing

A PROJECT FOR THE REPRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION OF 


MATERIALS FOR RESEARCH IN SMALL EDITIONS 


under consideration by the 


Joint Committee on Materials for Research 


of the 


American Council of Learned Societies 


and the 


Social Science Research Council 


I. The Problen. 

The term, materials for research, is 
here understood to refer to materials of 
three types: (1).reprints of out-of-print 
or rare items, =< books, pamphlets, news- 
paper or periodical files; (2) source mat-~ 
erial of considerable bulk, which in most 
cases would be copied and edited, but in 
some cases, merely reproduced in facsim- 
fle; (3) the original work of scholars, 
generally in the form of monographs. 

Such materials for research are at 
present published by agencies of three 
types, each specializing in publications 
for which a sale of different size may be 
expected: (1) commercial publishers or- 
dinarily issue books of which a thousand 
or more copies will be sold; (2) univer- 
sity presses specialize in books with a 
total sale averaging less than a thousand 
copies; (3) learned societies for the most 
part issue books with a total sale of 
less than three hundred copies. 

Since the cost of printing materials 
for research can seldom be covered by a 
sale of less than four hundred copies at 
normal prices (1.2 cents per page, or 375 
words for a cent), almost all such publi- 
Cations as the learned societies now issue 
must be subsidized, usually to the extent 
of two-thirds of their cost. Books issued 
by the university presses, of which as 
many as six hundred copies are sold, must 


also ordinarily be subsidized, to the ex- 
tent of one-third of their cost. Nor is 
the need for subsidies confined to agencies 
of the second and third types: 
publishers have frequently found it neces- 
sary to ask subsidies for books for which 

a sale of a thousand copies cannot be anti- 
cipated. In fact, experience has shown 
that the publication of materials for re- 


commercial 


search is seldom possible at present with- 
out a subsidy to cover at least a part of 
the loss incurred. 

The small sale for these publicat ions 
is probably due in the last analysis to 
the rapid advance of specialization, which 
has so far removed from general knowledge 
publications that are essential to further ° 
advance as to restrict their appreciation 
to specialists. But the restricted market 
that they might command is still further 


| diminished by the apparent preference of 


American scholars for depending on libra- 
ries to obtain the materials they need, 
rather than for purchasing them for persone 
al use. So long as this preference pre- 
vails, provision will have to be made for 
reproducing and distributing materials for 
research in the small editions that the 
market can absorb, if material essential 
to the progress of research is to be made 
available for the use of scholars. 

For most publications of this kind, 
subsidies will in any case be necessary,

and loss of keystrokes at the uneven right- 
hand margin). Then NK/CP is the number of 
keystrokes per column. 

The formula for making NK/CP key- 
strokes on a reduced size (or enlarged size) 
photo-offset column of given dimensions 
L x W inches can be worked out for any 
typewriter. 

Let A be the number of keystrokes 
per inch laid down by the typewriter (so 
that with a pica machine, A equals 10; 
with an elite machine, A equals 12; with a 
micro-elite machine, A equals 14; with a 
"nine-pitch" machine, A equals 9); and let 
B stand for the number of lines to the 
inch (which with ordinary single spacing is 
six, with double spacing is three, and 
with special spacings may be four, four and 
one-half, five, and five and one-half). 

Given chosen values for A and B, it 
remains to find W' and .L!, the width and 
length of the original typescript copy of 
a column from which the photo-offset page 
is to be photographically copied, in a re- 
duction ratio or enlargement ratio which 
will have the value R. 





The composition costs of typescript 
books, it has been proved, are highly vari- 
able; the principal levels for a book of 
50,000 words are determined by the five 
situations shown in Table XXIII. 

To simplify cost calculations, com- 
position cost will be taken for the third 
situation only--i.e., for typing done by a 
typing bureau at an average price. The 
typescript composition cost for photo-off- 
set will therefore stand at $62.50 for 
50,000 words. Although the differences in 
format will react upon this composition 
cost in some measure, this influence will 
be ignored. Substracting, then, the com- 
position cost from the two total sums sug- 
gested as alternatives (i.e., price of a 
mimeographed and price of a printed book), 
the following amounts remain for the pro- 
duction of a photo-offset book, exclusive

58 METHODS OF REPRODUCING RESEARCH MATERIALS 





In Chapter III area costs of photo- 
offset work are found. These indicate that 
the sums listed above will purchase the 
following amounts of page area in a photo- 
offset edition of 500 copies: 

For $95.50 can be bought 500 copies 
of twenty-eight pages, 8 1/2" x 11", which 
will require 1786 words to a page to repro- 
duce 50,000 words; or, $95.50 will buy 500 
copies of forty-four pages, 6" x 9 1/2" 
(twenty-two printings from a metal sheet 
9 1/2" x 12"), which will require 1136 
words per page to reproduce 50,000 words. 

How can the typescript copy be pre- 
pared to lay this number of words on a page 
in a format satisfactory for photo-offset 
in these sizes of metal sheet or paper? 

The arrangement of 6" x 9 1/2", 
less 1/2" margin on top, bottom and out- 
side, and with a 3/4" margin on the bound 
edge, can be made in this manner: two 
columns, each column 8 1/2" high, carrying 
568 words, in column width not greater than 
21/8", leaving 1/2" between columns. Such 
a column will roughly resemble newsprint 
in width. Counting 6 keystrokes per word 
to allow for spacing and loss on the right- 
hand margin, the number of keystrokes must 
be 3408 in a column 8 1/2" x 2 1/8". An 
interlinear spacing of five lines to the 
inch with pica type would be used. 

In full pica size, 8 1/2" will be 
filled with forty-two lines at five lines 
to the inch, and 2 1/8" with 21 keystrokes; 
at full size, therefore, this area will ac-— 
cept 882 keystrokes. But since it must ac- 
cept 5408 keystrokes in reduced size, the 
reduction must be such that four times this 
number of keystrokes will go on this area. 
The square root of four is two. The pica 
typescript must, therefore, stand at a re- 
duction of two diameters. Since 42 key- 
strokes reduced two diameters will fill the 
21/8" column, the typewriter should be 
set to make columns of this width (42 key- 
strokes, or 4.2") and carried to a column 
length of 17". When this is reduced photo- 
graphically, it is a reduction of approxi- 
mately 50%. (Figure XXXI.) 

In the 8 1/2" x 11" size of page 
the necessary 1786 words would probably 
best be set in three columns. Making mar- 
gin allowances of 3/4" inside margin, 1/2" 
between columns and for outer margin, and 
1" on the top and bottom, the effective 
width of the columns would be 2.08" and the 


Each column would be 
required to take 595 words, or 5570 key- 


height would be 9". 


strokes. A reduction ratio of 50% will be 
necessary. Pica typescript reduced to 50% 
of original size will suffice in this for- 
mat. In the format copying, the typist 
should make each line 443 keystrokes long 
(4.3") and the column should be typed to 
18" in height. (Figure XXXII.) 

Thus it appears that there are at 
least two formats in which a photo-offset 
copy of a 50,000-word text could be made 
for a price equivalent to the cost of a 
mimeograph copy. The choice of an 8 1/2" 

x 11" format would involve reduction of 
pica typescript by 50%; the choice of the 
6" x 9 1/2" format would also mean a reduc- 
tion of 50%. The typescript format copy 
for the 6" x 9 1/2" page could be prepared 
on a typewriter with a 12"-carriage (two 
columns, each column 4.2", with 1/2" mar- 
gin between them); the format copy for the 
8 1/2" x 11" page would call for a type- 
writer carriage that would make three col- 
umns, each 4.5", with two internal margins 
of 1/2", and hence a 15"-carriage would be 
necessary. Of course the typing could be 
done one column at a time on the typewriter, 
and the columns then mounted together to 
make the format copy. 

The essential significance of this 
whole demonstration is, first, that photo- 
offset formats can be designed to bring 
photo-offset costs down to the level of 
mimeographing; and second, that when for- 
mats are so designed to bring the photo- 
offset costs to this level, the legibility 
diminishes below that of the corresponding 
mimeograph copy. Pica typescript reduc- 
tions of 50% are close to the lower limit 
of legibility without a reading glass. 

If the composition cost is set ata 
lower level by basing it upon a wage rate 
in an office, the number of 8 1/2" x 11" 
pages upon which the 50,000 words would be 
spread would be increased from twenty-eight 
to thirty-two, because there would be more 
money left over from typescript composition 
to pay for the photo-offset work. It would 
then be necessary to put only 1560 words on 
a page instead of 1786, only 520 words ina 
column instead of 595. This could be ac-— 
complished by reducing the typescript only 
47%, toc5oe. Oram tSetul mest ze,

this page is to show that (a) photo-offset 
costs can be brought down to the level of 
mimeographing, and (b) when photo-offset

the corresponding mimeograph copy. To 
demonstrate this fact, the reader is asked 
to compare this page with Figure XXVII, a 
mimeograph format that is in the same cost 
range. A book of 50,000 words, reproduced 
in this format, would cost $158.00, includ 
ing the cost of typing the master copy. Al- 
lowing $62.50 for the composition cost, a 
sum of $95.50 is left to pay for the run- 
ning costs. This amount of money will buy 
500 copies of forty-four pages, size 6" 

x 94", To put 50,000 words on forty-four 
pages, there must be 1136 words on a page, 
or 568 words per column in a two-column 
format such as this one. 

To fit these specifications, the mas- 
ter copy is typed in two columns, each col- 
umn being 4.4" wide and 17" long. Pica 
type with an interlinear spacing of five 
lines to the inch is used. The master copy 
is then given to the photo-offset estab- 
lishment with instructions that it is to be 
reduced 50%. This sample page illustrates 
the appearance of the final product. The 
reader may judge for himself the diminish- 
ing curve of legibility as the amount of 
money available for running costs decreases. 
This extremely low-priced photo-offset for- 
mat may be compared with a medium-priced 
mimeographing format which also costs 
$158.00 for 50,000 words.

This page illustrates a photo-offset 
format that has been designed to conform to 
the cost levels of medium-priced mimeo- 
graphing. The essential significance of 
this page is to show that (a) photo-offset 
costs can be brought down to the level of 
mimeographing, and (b) when photo-offset 
formats are designed for this cost level, 
their legibility diminishes below that of 
the corresponding mimeograph copy. To 
demonstrate this fact, the reader is asked 
to compare this page with Figure XXVII, a 
mimeograph format that is in the same cost 
range. A book of 50,000 words, reproduced 
in this format, would cost $158.00, includ- 
ing the cost of typing the master copy. Al- 
lowing $62.50 for the composition cost, a 
sum of $95.50 is left to pay for the run- 
ning costs. This amount of money will buy 
500 copies of forty-four pages, size 6" 

x 93". To put 50,000 words on forty-four 
pages, there must be 1136 words on a page, 
or 568 words per column in a two-column 
format such as this one. 

To fit these specifications, the mas- 
ter copy is typed in two columns, each col- 
umn being 4.4" wide and 17" long. Pica 
type with an interlinear spacing of five 
lines to the inch is used. The master copy

probably best used for the mimeograph. 

Using Hoch's figures, as given in 
Chapter III, it is found that $95.50 will

Again, as has been explained in the 
text, it is possible to give a larger pro- 
portion of the $158.00 to the running costs 
by either doing the typing personally and 
not counting the cost in, or by having it 
done by cheap labor. However, it is 
quite possible that the typing would be of 
such inferior quality that the amount 
saved for running costs would be much bet- 
ter spent for composition. 

This format again illustrates the sav-— 
ing that is made possible by the use of a 
special spacer. Five lines to the inch is 
used for this format, instead of the usual 
six lines to the inch (regular single

legibility, or the three lines to the inch 
(regular double spacing) which is too wide- 
spread to be economical.

FIGURE XXXIII 





This photo-offset page is made up in a format that costs 
the same to reproduce as an economical print format. The 
$365.00 that would be required to print 50,000 words is here 
devoted to making a photo-offset reproduction from typescript. 
$62.50 of it is allotted to the composition cost, leaving 
$302.50 to pay for the running costs. This amount will buy 
500 copies of sixty-nine pages, 93" x 12", or, as with this 
format, 138 pages, 6" x 93". With the larger size page, only 
725 words need be put on each page; with this 6" x 93" page, 
only 363 words need be put on each page. 

Leaving wide margins and typing in a single column with 
four-lines-to-the-inch spacing, a reduction of 33% takes care 
of the word content. The resulting page is a very legible 
and very expensive way of putting the photo-offset process 
Imtomuse™. 

If it should happen that the format copy were then sent 
to a photo-offset printer for quotation who was using a press 
with a 17" x 22" metal sheet, his quotation for the job would 
be substantially higher than the figure of $302.50 that is 
the basis of this calculation, because he would have to run 
the whole printing surface to get four pages of 6" x 93", 
and the wastage of his metal sheet printing surface would be 
almost 40%. This fact is brought into the picture to empha- 
size the importance of considering, in the planning of a for- 
mat, not only the arrangement of typescript columns that will 
lay the required number of words on a page, but also the rela- 
tion of the page size chosen to the dimensions of the metal 
sheet of the press upon which it is to be run.

the same to reproduce as an economical print format. The

Assume that on pay day, January 4, $440.00 is paid to workmen. This payment 
would represent the discharge of a wage liability of $250.00 already on the books (the 
credit balance in the Wages Expense accowmt), and the payment of $190.00 labor expense 
of the new period. The entire $440.00 should be charged to the Wages Expense accounts

The balance of the account, $190.00, is the correct wage expense for the new pe 
riod. | 
Other examples of accrued expenses are advertising, commissions, interest, sal 
aries, workmen's compensation insurance; also the utility services, gas, electricity, 
and water. 
Adjusting entries for accrued expenses are necessary, for, without such adjust 
ments: 


- the expenses of the period will be understated, 

- the net income overstated, and 

- the balance sheet will be incorrect because of the omis-— 
sion of accrued expenses from its liability side. 


DEFERRED INCOME 

Some incomes may be recorded on the books before they are earned. Suppose foi 
instance, that an insurance company credits Insurance Income for an initial annual pre 
mium of $2,400.00, which it receives on December 1, from a new policy holder. When tl 
books are closed December 31, it would not be correct to consider all of the $2,400.00 
as income earned in the period ending that date. This is because the insurance prote 
tion is rendered not for one month but for twelve months. It follows that since 1/12 | 
the insurance protection is rendered during December, 1/12 of the income, or $200.00, 
should be credited to that month. The remaining 11/12ths, or $2,200.00, should be cret 
ited to the income of the new year. . 

A statement of principle may therefore be made: income which has been record 
on the books but which is, in whole, or in part, unearned income at the end of an ac-— 
counting period, should be removed from the income account of the -current period and ¢ 
ried forward to the next period as unearned, or deferred, income. The accounting en 
tries are as follows: 

Income accounts are debited with the amowmt to be deferred, and the credits ar 
made either to separate liability accowmts,--one account for each type of deferred in 
come,--or to one summary account called Deferred Income. The latter method is ordina- 
rily to be preferred. Unless further-other adjustments are necessary, the income ac- 
counts are closed to Profit and Loss, and the account with Deferred Income is carried 
to the balanee sheet as a liability. It is a liability because it isvan oplipation 
which is payable, not in cash, but in services.

printing shop for quotations, and that the 
quotations for a printed product are about 
the same as those for a photo-offset book 
from typescript. This is invariably the 
result of the choice of format for the 
photo-offset book. The printing prices, as 
has been proved in Chapter III above, can- 
not respond as actively to change in for- 
mat as the photo-offset prices. To ask "is 
photo-offset as expensive as printing?" is 
to avoid the essential element in photo- 
offset pricing, namely area cost and re- 
duction ratio of the typescript. By calcu- 
lations corresponding to those used above, 
it is easy to determine a format in whicha 
typescript book, reproduced in 500 copies 
by photo-offset, will cost as much as_ the 
same book reproduced in print. 

If the $365 that would be required 
to print 50,000 words is devoted to making 
a photo-offset reproduction from typescript, 
$62.50 of it must be allotted to typescript 
composition, leaving $302.50 to pay for the 
photo-offset work itself. This will pay 
etor 500 copies of 69 pages, 9 1/2" x 12", 
Bor 158 pages, 6" x 91/2", It would be 
'necessary to put no more than 725 words on 
each 9 1/2" x 12" page, or 368 words on 
each 6" x 9 1/2" page. Leaving wide mar- 
'gins and typing in a single column with 
five-lines-to-the-inch spacing, a reduction 
of 24%, to 76% of full size, would take 
care of the 9 1/2" x 12" page. The typist 
would simply set the stops to write 85 key- 
strokes to a line (8.56"), type 60 lines on 
a page, and ask the photo-offset printer to 
reduce the page to 76% of full size. On 
the 6" x 9 1/2" page, the typist would set 
the stops to write 54 to 55 keystrokes, 
type 47 lines at four-lines-—to-the-inch 
Spacing, and ask the printer to reduce it 
33% to 67% of full size. (See Figure 
XXXIII.) The resulting pages would be very 
neat, very legible, and a very expensive 
way of using the photo-offset process. 

If it should happen that the format 
copy were then sent for quotation to a 
_photo-offset printer who was using a press 
with a 17" x 22" metal sheet, his quotation 
for the job would be substantially higher 
than the figure of $302.50 that is the ba- 
sis of this calculation, because he would 
_have to run the whole 17" x 22" to get four 
pages 6" x 9 1/2", and the wastage of his 
metal sheet printing surface would be al- 
"most 40%. This fact is brought into the 








picture to emphasize the importance of con- 
sidering, in the planning of a format, not 
only the arrangement of typescript columns 
that will lay the required number of words 
on a page, but also the relation of the 
page size chosen to the dimensions of the 
metal sheet of the press upon which it is 
to be run. 

In the first edition of this manual, 
the writer gathered quotations on the manu- 
facture of photo-offset typescript books 
and fitted them to a chart in which they 
were compared to the manufacturing prices 
of printed books. It has become evident, 
as a result of further study, that this way 
of presenting the comparison is completely 
misleading because it ignores the vital fac- 
tor of format. Therefore, in this analysis 
of the use of photo-offset to reproduce 
typescript, several formats are designed, 
and the manufacturing prices of a book in 
each format are calculated. These prices 
are sufficiently checked with actual quota- 
tions to make them indicative of the gener- 
al price levels at which photo-offset can 
be used. (See Figures XXXIV and XXXV.) 


Photo-Offset from Normal Fair Copy, with- 


out Additional Format Typing 
It will often happen that a fair 


copy of a manuscript has been made in the 
ordinary typescript format, 300 words to 
the page. This question then arises: shall 
the text be retyped as a special format 
copy for photo-offset reproduction, or shall 
the fair copy be used as a format copy? 
This is a special case of the problem of 
controlling typescript composition costs by 
merging fair and format typing operations. 
It can now be given a specific answer. 

A manuscript of 50,000 words, typed 
in the normal 300-word format, fills 166 
pages. To retype this manuscript in a spe- 
cial format for photo-offset reproduction 
would cost $62.50. Now this $62.50, if di- 
verted from the payment of composition cost 
to the payment of area cost, will buy nine- 
teen extra pages, 81/2" x 11", or 28 
extra pages, 6" x 9 1/2", in an edition of 
500. If this $62.50, instead of going to 
composition, is actually paid to the offset 
printer, the text can be spread over this 
additional amount of page area without 
changing the total cost of the edition. The 
additional page area released to the photo- 
offset by an elimination of the retyping

process is the same, regardless of the to- 
tal amount spent for the publication. 
Whether the book is to be published for 
Pipe O0nor fori$ses.00;, et wilt etid a be 
true that the money diverted from composi- 
tion cost will buy exactly the same amount 
of additional photo-offset surface. 
Will it pay to make this diver- 
sion? Will retyping so greatly increase 
the efficiency in the use of photo-offset 
page area as to justify reducing the num- 
ber of available pages upon which the text 
is to be reproduced? This special case of 
the fair copy-format copy problemis particu- 
larly important, because the 300-word for- 
mat is the normal one in which typescripts 
are prepared, and in which they are pre- 
sented to editors or bound as typescript 
dissertations. 
It has been shown above that the 
50,000 word text can be retyped and repro- 
duced in a 6" x 9 1/2" or an 8 1/2" x 11" 
book for $158.00 (the same price as mimeo- 
graphing) by reducing the pica typescript 
to..50%. of full size. 
If the entire $158.00 is spent for 
photo-ofiset work, it will buy six full 
sheets 22" x 34" ($153.66). These six 
sheets will divide into 168 pages of 5 1/2" 
x 4 6/7", This particular way of folding 
the sheet will cause an additional expense 
in gathering, but the extra expense will 
probably not exceed the difference between 
$153.66 and $158.00. The normal typescript 
pages, reduced to go on pages of this size, 
must pass through a reduction of 45%, leav- 
ing them 55% of full size. The page would 
then have a 1/2" margin top and bottom, and 
side margins of nearly an inch. This re- 
duction ratio would be the same if the 
typescript pages were reduced to go on 
pages 5 1/2" x 4 1/4", made by folding 
8 1/2" x 11" sheets into four, and costing, 
for the edition, $133.40. The difference 
between $133.40 and $153.66 would be an un- 
necessary expense for needless width of 
side margins. The alternatives in the 
"ear-—print" reproduction of a fair copy 
of normal typescript are therefore: 
1. To retype and mimeograph 
($158.00) 

2. To photo-offset without retyp- 
ing, reducing to 55% of full 
size ($133.40) 








3. To retype and photo-offset, re- 
ducing to 50% of full size 
($158.00). 

Another standard price level is sug- 
gested by the dimensions and word count of 
the normal typescript page, because of the 
importance of utilizing the full area of 
the photo-offset metal sheet. This is the 
size 8 1/2" x 5 1/2", obtained by reducing 
a full page of typescript to a half page of 
photo-offset. Metal sheets that will take 
an 8 1/2" x 11" page without wastage will 
also take the 8 1/2" x 5 1/2" without wast-— 
age. If top and bottom margins of 3/4" are 
left on the photo-offset page, the reduc-— 
tion of the typescript will be 23%, to 77% 
of full size, and the cost of the edition 
of 500 will be $265.00. This isianprice 
level at which the innumerable bound theses 
that fill the shelves of graduate schools 
could be brought conveniently into print 
without retyping. 

If the: sum of $265.00) ts ton be 
spent to reproduce typescript in a retyped 
format, it can be made to yield a two- 
column page 8 1/2" x 11", with each column 
3.6" wide, and 1/2" margins top and bottom, 
in exactly the same reduction, namely 23%. 


Therefore the cost of reproducing 
a_ typescript by photo-offset in a reduc- 
tion of 23% would be the same, whether or 
not the additional format typing were 
done. The saving of page area involved 
in shifting from one column to two, and 
from normal double spacing to special spac-— 
ing four and one-half-to-the-inch, and 
from the 3/4" to the 1/2" top and bottom 
margin, would exactly pay the cost of the 
format typing. 

These figures make possible an in- 
teresting comparison with the actual price

Edwards Brothers offer to type and manufac-

normal fair copy of 8 1/2" x 5 1/2™ photo—

The difference between the "Edwards type" and the "author type" figures for 50,000 
words is $39.00; the price of the typing is therefore to be reckoned at $.78 per

The Edwards! model 700-D requires 
seventy-two pages for the 50,000 words; the 
Edwards! quotations for typing in this for- 
mat are $.78 per 1000 words instead of the 
$1.25 which is the average figure. The com- 
position cost is figured at $39.00 for the 
700-D model with 50,000 words. The price 
of an edition of 500 copies typed by the 
author is $225.00; the price of an edition 
typed at the shop is about $39.00 more (or 
$264.00). Edwards quotes $265.00 for the 
shop-typed copy. 

There are other contrasts to be ex- 
amined. The Hoch quotations for 500 copies 
Ore page 6 1/2" x ll" stand at $5,205 
Edwards prints this amount of matter, col- 
lates, and includes a cheap binding for 
$3.68. But the Hoch quotations show a con- 
stant proportionate relationship between 
the prices of full metal sheets and half 
sheets. If Edwards Brothers sets up the 
8 1/2" x 11" area in the form of two pages, 
8 1/2" x 5 1/2", the price is equivalent to 
$3.92 instead of Hochts $3.20. Of course 
the collating and binding cost counts for 
something in this comparison, but the fig- 
ures reveal nonetheless a certain elastici- 
ty in costs per square inch of page (area 
costs) and in running cost behavior. 

The buyer of photo-offset service 
ean conclude from these illustrations that 
it is wise to secure quotations separated 
imto the three parts: 

1. Area costs (page area chosen to 

fit metal sheets) 

2. Running costs (quoted as a con- 
stant figure per additional hun- 
dreds of copies) 

S. Typing costs (quoted in thou- 
sands of words, or in pages ofa 
specific format) 

With these quotations in hand, he 

can divide the work and plan his format to 
produce maximum legibility at minimum cost. 


Typing Instructions 

Since these tables reveal a consid- 
erable difference in costs and prices de- 
pendent upon the character of a composi- 
tion cost, instructions for the preparation 
of a format copy for the photo-offset type- 
script book are properly a part of this 
chapter. 

Since the typescript copy must bea 
photographic object it should be as black 
as possible. Some companies recommend the 


METHODS OF REPRODUCING RESEARCH MATERIALS 











use of a special bronze ribbon; in all cases 
the ribbon should be fresh and black. To 
avoid an uneveness in the impression pro- 
duced by the fabric of the typewriter rib- 
bon a special silk ribbon or one made of 
carbon paper may be used. The typewriter 
type must be perfectly clean and the touch 
of the typist even; the Electromatic type- 
writer may be used to great advantage here. 
Format instructions as to line 
length, interlinear spacing, etc., are most 
easily followed out if paper with a printed 
margin line can be provided, clearly de- 
signating the typing area. Photo-offset 
printers often provide such sheets. With 
paper so marked, and with the right ratchet 
and ribbon on the typewriter, and the right 
paper on the roller, any standard typewrit- 
er and any normally efficient typist should 
be able to turn out superior work. 
There are two ways of preparing 
typescript for the two-column page. The 
copy can be typed directly on a large sheet 
marked off into two columns or upon a long 
one-column galley, to be cut and fastened 
on the two-column page backing with rubber 
cement. The former is perhaps the better 
method in handling copy which is absolutely 
"straight"--no footnotes, no illustrations, 
no probability of author's revisions. But 
if the design of the page requires so many 
letters per column that the two columns 
cannot be typed together on the normal 10"- 
carriage, or if there is a prospect of many 
corrections or of footnote material to be 
fitted in place, the galley strip method of 
typing is probably superior. 
All corrections may be made with 
shears and rubber cement. The new matter 
may be placed on top of the old, or else 
the deleted matter may be cut out and the 
new matter pasted in its place. 
Paste pot and shears will also 
serve to make page proofs of galley proofs. 
The paper for the page proof should have a 
strong line running down the middle if the 
final copy is to show the two columns di- 
vided by a line. Diagrams, photographs, 
and other non-typescript matter can be fit- 
ted into the pages at this stage in the 
preparatory process.

GQ SPECIMEN PAGE OF @ SCRIBE BOOK 


For the artistic reproduction of a manuscript an alternative to the- 
use of the usual type faces and of typescript presents itself that is as 
intriquing as it is simple. This alternative is the preparation by a trained 
scribe of the copy to be photographically reproduced by the photo-oftset or 
photo-gelatine. processes. 

'The transition from writing to printing only gradually changed the ap- 
pearance of book pages. The first printers, in fact, strove to make their 
books as nearly like manuscripts as possible. The Blasius copy of the Gutenberg 
Bible is said to have been represented as a manuscript by John Fust and to 
have been sold as such in Paris. The early printers designed type faces~ 
which imitated the form of letters with which they were familiar. 'The- 
German printers copied the pointed style which later acquired the name 
of gothic and which had been used during the Middle Gges for produc- 
ing the psalters, missals, breviaries, and the Bibles of the Church. The 
talian printers developed a face in the humanistic style: a round, neat 
Script coming in with the Renaissance. This style became known as— 
roman and reached its greatest perfection under Nicholas Jenson. Only 
gradually were type faces designed which were quite unlike the writing 
of the copyists of the Middle Ages. 

With the mass production of the twentieth century, there has come 
a standardization of type faces which tends to minimize the individuality 
of a book. But with the application of photography to printing the u- 
nique quality of the writing of trained scribes can recapture the artistry 
of individual workmanship. The books prepared by scribes possess a 
personality all their own. G conspicuous example of such a book is~ 
that produced by Gnna Simons, the Sonetti, Ballate. Sestine of Dante 
Qlighieri in the Bibliotheca Manu Scripta. The cost of creating such 


books, of course, would vary with the individual scribes. " a

working clothes; others we expect to see 
parading in formal dress. Typescript and 
newsprint are the clothes that thought 
wears in its daily work; the typography of 
book manufacture is its more formal attire. 
But the formal dress that thought acquires 
in book typography is only a ready-made 
Suut atter all: calligraphy offers to 
elothe thought in much richer and more 
beautiful tailor-made attire, which should 
have a higher prestige value than book ty- 
pography. 

The beauty of the manuscript has 
been increasingly appreciated as the cen- 
turies have confirmed the triumph of let- 
terpress. Precisely the same qualities 
that make printing more attractive than 
typescript would tend to make manuscript 
more attractive than printing. There is 
more chance for close adaptation of letter 
Beorm to the spirit of the text, more chance 
for creative artistry. 

The twentieth century has already 
developed its scribes. The influence of 
Edward Johnston, author of the foremost 
general book on illuminating and lettering 
aligl English, ° has been felt not only in the 
beautification of typographical design but 
also in the growth, especially on the Con- 
'tinent, of a school of artists in whose 
work calligraphy meets creative literature, 
Pictorial, art and bookbinding in a prod- 
uct which adapts medieval craft to modern 
design. 
































| The handwritten book, as made by a 
penman like Rudolf Spemann, is, however, a 
marivys Lts costs are high and its editions 
small, with the result that the average 
person seldom sees and never possesses a 
manuscript book. 

But now a new prospect opens: the 
manuscript can come back in current pub- 
lishing; the graphic arts are prepared to 
make it available to the common man. Photo- 
offset will multiply any black on white for- 








mat copy, whether prepared by relief print— 
ing, typewriting or calligraphy. The inex- 
pensive photo-offset press may make possi- 
ble a production of manuscript books as a 
special smalim=scale craivus) thie art of the 
scribe can now return, relieved from the 
rule of constant costs which placed it) -at 
such a disadvantage in competing with di- 
Mnishine costs of the printing crart. Ihe 
illustration on the preceding page serves 
to show what might be done in this line. 
(Figure XXXVI.) 


Cost Analysis: Composition Costs 


The area and running costs of a 
manuscript book reproduced by photo-offset 
do not differ from those of any other kind 
of book reproduced by this technique. The 
difference comes in composition costs, 
which naturally are high as compared with 
those of typescript and linotype work. 
There are no set prices for handwritten 
master copy, but an estimate of 1200 words 
per day at $3.00 or thirty pages a week for 
#20.00 was made for the Joint Committee. 

These prices would naturally be 
prohibitive for the 50,000-word book chosen 
as a standard for the other pages in this 
chapter. They would be reasonable, however, 
for the reproduction of current literature 
--say, a small volume of poetry. The repro- 
CWC PLOMe One CUIMReMtb es IeiiZe rang near Indy voll Smet ram 
might have an interesting effect upon cul- 
ture, for it might help to implement cul- 
tural decentralization away from the great 
metropolitan centers. It would have little 
bearing, however, upon the problem of re- 
producing research materials except as 10 
would help to deprive book typography of 
its privileged place as an arbiter of in- 
tellectual quality.
