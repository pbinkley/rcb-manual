FOREWORD 


The Joint Committee on Materials for Research had its 


inception in action taken by the Social Science Research Council at 
Hanover conference in August, 1929. At this conference the Coun- 
approved a tentative definition of its objective which included 
Nenlargement, improvement, and preservation of materials." This 
elaborated as follows:

Cus

was 


"Since scientific progress in all fields is conditioned 


by the existence of a constantly enlarging body of research materials 
and by its availability to investigators, one of the primary duties of 
the Council is to promote such objects and to concern itself with the 
improvement and preservation of research data. In carrying out these 
purposes the following courses of action are appropriate: 


A. 


Initiating and participating in plans for making more compara- 
ble and more widely serviceable the classifications of social 
and economic data, for making more precise the significance of 
the data, and for otherwise improving such records. 

Helping to lay out a plan for the nation-wide development and 
COOMA bon ote SiMe mamchinvelacollectuoncs ands normthe 
building up of new research collections along special lines at 
strategic scholarly and geographical centers. 

Initiating and participating in plans for constructing union 
finding lists and calendars of the resources of existing re- 
Sscanch i brarices, wlth particular reference to their social 
data, so as to make them more available to scholars. 
Initiating and participating in plans to discover, select, 
edit, publish, or otherwise reproduce basic data in the social 
SCLrences ay iach marendi hi icwtteOnmaccesss uO Students: or likeli: 
to perish. 

Calling to the attention of individuals and of governmental, 
business, and other institutions and agencies the importance 
of preserving their records for future analysis and study. 
Encouraging the adoption and widespread use of those varieties 
of paper and other materials used in the making of records 
which promise a maximum durability. 

Initiating, encouraging, and participating in plans to develop 
the research uses of historical, industrial, and social 
museums; and encouraging the building up of new collections 
with these purposes in mind." 


The American Council of Learned Societies, which is in- 


terested primarily in the humanities, including history, had concerned 


itself for some years with materials for research; 


and, as the problems 


of the two Councils in this field are much the same and often involve 
the same material, it was logical for them to join in setting up a 


joint committee on materials for research.

In the course of its first two meetings in 1930, the com- 
mittee set on foot three surveys. A "Survey of Activities of American 
Agencies in Relation to Materials for Research in the Social Sciences 
and Humanities" was compiled by Franklin F. Holbrook, under the direc- 
tion of Professor Solon J. Buck, and published in a small edition in the 
spring of 1932. A study of the categories of research material which 
ought to be collected and preserved was undertaken by a subcommittee 
headed by Professor Gras. The task of making a survey of methods of re- 
producing research materials was assigned to Robert C. Binkley, then 
secretary of the committee. A tentative edition of this survey was is- 
sued in December, 1931, and circulated for corrections and additions, 
which have been incorporated in the present edition. 


ACKNOWLEDGMENT 


The collaboration of scholars, technicians, and busi- 
ness men in the preparation of this manual has been generous and long- 
continued. The list of names carried in the index is in itself a 
list of helpful collaborators to whom acknowledgment is due. If the 
list were to be extended to all who have given sympathetic aid, it 
would cover pages. 


The correspondence covering the matters brought to- 
gether in this book has been carried on for six years. The conclu- 
sions here set forth have been slowly crystallized in the presence of 
constantly changing cost levels and constantly improved mechanical 
equipment. Much of the book that deals with tabulations of cost and 
with descriptions of equipment will undoubtedly be outdated in the 
near future; some of it is perhaps already out of date at the moment 
of going to press. 


It is hoped, however, that the basic thought of the book 
will still stand: namely, that the great variety of devices which mod- 
ern technology offers to modern scholarship should be kept under con- 
stant scrutiny, both from the standpoint of utility and of comparative

CHAPTER I 


THE SETTING OF THE PROBLEM OF REPRODUCING RESEARCH MATERIALS 








Research in the social sciences 
and humanities is unlike research in the 
natural sciences in that it uses written 
TES EUs} ales joncaliay@aljoeil wiehocaaulewl, Ubayes seaseshe 
Guty of scholarship is to protect and pre- 
Serve) Original writings, the loss of which 
would be irretrievable. Except in the 
case of records committed to perishable pa- 
per, this service does not call for the re— 
production of the texts. But great impor- 
tance must also be attached to those me- 
chanical impediments which hinder a scholar 
whenever he is compelled to alter his plans 
or suspend his work because he can neither 
go to the material he needs nor have the 
material brought to him. Unless a given 
body of research material is reproduced in 
so many copies and distributed in so many 
DlACeSmUna tebe Ls accessable: bo) all ithe 
scholars who wish to use it, the mechanical 
impediment to the use of that body of ma- 
terial has not been wholly removed. 

In the days when the classics and 
the works of the Fathers constituted the 
principal body of research material, a 
scholar was not unlikely to have the core 
of his research material in his own private 
library. As the scope of the disciplines 
expanded and the stock of printed matter 
accumulated, increasing dependence was 
placed on the college or university libra- 
ries. A generation of great librarians 
solved the problems of cataloguing and ad- 
ministering these libraries. Now, as the 
“tonnage of needed material continues to in- 
crease, the ordinary college library be- 
comes as inadequate as the private library, 
and the prospect appears that nothing less 
than the whole system of research libra- 
ries, codperating with each other and allo- 
cating responsibilities among themselves,

In dealing with the problem of re- 
search materials, three interests are to be 
distinguished: those of the scholar as a 
producer, of the scholar as a consumer, and 
of the library as a custodian. The scholar 
as a producer wants to see his manuscript

large an edition as possible. Although 
"book form" is an arbitrary and mechanical 
eriterion of scholarly value, it is given 
weight in-academic circles. The consumer 
interest is that of the man who is uSing a 


library. All the documents of which he 
makes use are for him "materials for re- 
search." He does not care whether they are 


printed or typewritten or in manuscript 
form, whether durable or perishable, wheth-— 
er original or photostat, so long as they 
are legible. Whether the edition is large 
OG Smal wether tie library, buys... begs, 
or borrows the material makes no difference 
to him so long as he can have it in hand 
when he wants it. The custodian's inter- 
est has to do with the demands of future 
generations of scholars. The growth of 
each library must be so directed that its 
present acquisitions dovetail with past and 
future acquisitions. The custodian must 
also undertake to gather items for which 
there is no present demand on the part of 
the "consumer"; he may seek especially to 
care for the unique things which are no- 
where else collected and preserved. cileverite 
these interests may be difficult to recon— 
cile with each other is illustrated both in

In the production of books the line 
of technical development has been in the 
direction of lower costs for larger edi- 
tions. Rotary presses and wood-pulp paper, 
as well as the sales and promotion policies

of publishers, emphasize the importance of 
securing a wide market. But scholarship, 
with its tendency to increased specializa- 
tion, has been constantly diminishing the 
number of probable users of any given 
scholarly publication. Publishers! require— 
ments are met with impermanent papers, while 
the custodians! interests call for maximum 
permanence. 

In the distribution of books, that 
Toe LOMSay., ame tie LOrmblaganewon laliprary 
acquisition policies, the consumer and cus- 
todian interests clash. The graduate 
schools are feeding into the university and 
college system a highly trained personnel, 
expected to pursue research work along with 
teaching. To secure the maximum of re- 
search effort from this teaching personnel, 
the libraries should be so equipped that 
any scholar can pick up his work and go on 
with it wherever he may happen to be teach- 
ing. In the attempt to meet the need, li- 
brary funds are turned this way and that, 
regardless of long-term policies, to sup- 
ply the research requirements of the man 
who happens to be on the ground. But this 
interferes with the distribution of field 
among libraries, which is necessary if the 
total resources of scholarship are to be 
used most efficiently in collecting and 
preserving materials. 

An inquiry into the techniques of 
reproducing research materials is called 
for at the present time because there are 
coming to light new processes and devices 
which, taken in their entirety, promise to 
have an impact on the intellectual world 
comparable with that of the invention of 
printing. The typewriter and the photo- 


stat were the precursors of the array of 
new devices, among which the planograph, or 
photo-offset, and the miniature film copy 
have the most interesting possible applica- 
tions. The photo-offset process now con- 
trols the bringing back into print. on sold 
books, pamphlets, and journals. A few more 
inventions along the present line of tech- 
nological development may result in render- 
ing "reprinting" a kind of simple addition 
to the functions of a library, as photo- 
stating has come to be. The use of minia-— 
ture film copies is in its very infancy, 
but progress along its line of development 
would tend to bring the cost of making a 
unique copy of a book lower than the normal 
original purchase price, lower perhaps than 
the cost of mailing and returning an inter- 
library loan--a situation with revolution-— 
ary implications. Book and" journals publish — 
ing, now taken for granted as the sole 
channels for the flow of an intellectual 
product, may be challenged by the conse- 
quences of these technological changes. Per- 
haps the time may come when the internal 
documents of scholarship will circulate 
like the internal documents of a great busi- 
ness enterprise, with the journal and the 
book appearing in their present volume as 
vehicles of communication, but supplemented 
by innumerable memoranda drawn up and mul- 
tiplied by inexpensive office duplicating 
processes. “Such possi pila ties Mich siamo

ent there is required only an attentive 
watching of the new processes and an effort 
to compare them, fitting each one into its 
most appropriate place.

CHAPTER II 


PUBLISHING AND LIBRARY COSTS: 


The point of reference from which 
the problem of reproducing research materi- 
als must be examined is the system by which 
publishers produce books and libraries ac- 
quire, arrange, and store them for use. The 
iimanciab policies of institutions, the 
stack room and reading room equipment of 
libraries, the training of library person- 
nel, as well as the research habits of 
scholars, are standardized in favor of the 
use of books of several hundred pages, from 
6" to 11" in height, costing the purchaser 
Promee.00n to 8.02 a page. 

There are other forms in which re- 
search material is made accessible, but in 
any of these other forms there is created 
a special problem of finance or adminis- 
tration. Maps, newspapers, "oversize" 
HOOKS. Manuscript collections, films, coll— 
lections of pamphlets and broadsides pre- 
sent special difficulties and cause special 
expenses regardless of their acquisition

Scholarly books published in Ameri- 
ca are sold at an average price of $1.20 
per 100 pages, scholarly periodicals at 
$.70 per 100 pages.! A library dollar buys

ume rises above the level at which the nor-

individuals will float the enterprise and 
accomplish adequate distribution, the point 
is reached where commercial and scholarly 
needs conflict with each other. The criti-

edition which can be sold within the nor- 
mal price range. 

Another striking characteristic of 
book costs is the high percentage of the 
sale price which goes to pay for other 
things than manufacturing costs. One uni- 
versity press reports that 23% to 50% of 
all money received goes to pay for distri- 
bution. Another reports that it calculates 
that only 40% of the cost of a book is the 
actual production cost. Two very complete 
estimates and analyses of book costs are 
available in the surveys made by Mr. O. H. 
Cheney and Mr. Donald Bean.® Mr. Cheney 
reports on commercial publishing, Mr. Bean 
on scholarly publishing. Both writers cal- 
culate the disposition of the money actual- 
ly received by the publisher. In the case 
of commercial publishing this is much less 
than the amount paid for the books by the 
consumer, because the retail dealer's prof- 
it of 40% must be included. The commercial 
publisher's dollar is the consumer's $.60. 

The dealer's discount in scholarly 
publishing is reckoned at 30% by Mr. Bean, 
and the calculation is further made that 
the scholarly publisher is subsidized by 
authors and institutions to the extent of 
35% of his costs. Therefore the publish- 
er's dollar in scholarly publishing is the 
consumer's $1.07. For every dollar paid by 
the consumer for a commercial book, the 
publisher gets $.60; for every dollar paid 
retail for a scholarly book, the publisher 
gets $1.07. 


TABLE 





These relationships between cost 
and price must receive further analysis, 
but in the meantime note must be made of 
the distribution which publishers make of 
each dollar* they receive. (See Table I.) 

Part of the larger percentage of 
manufacturing costs found in Mr. Bean's fig- 
ures may be due to the inclusion of some 
items which Mr. Cheney classes as overhead. 
Moreover, Mr. Bean's whole system of ac- 
counting seems to disregard separate books 
after the first year of sales and to total 
revenues from later sales to pay overhead 
costs. If an 18% overhead, presumably from 
sales of ol@ books, is tigured intos sii

The larger manufacturing cost ratio in 
scholarly publishing is the result of the 
smaller edition. 

If every edition were invariably 
sold out, the retail price of a book could 
be fixed by dividing the cost of the whole 
edition into the number of copies and add- 
ing a profit. Actually, because of the 
risk element, the selling price must be much

Arthur Meiner in the German Boersenblatt

cal figures by Mr. Bean: 


——_ 


ee 


The largest element of print 
cost--the composition or typesetting 
--is a cost per page which is inde- 
pendent of the number of copies print- 
ed. The composition of a 400-page 
book, for example, at $2.25 per page 
is $900.00. If the number of books

cost of composition is $.90 per copy; 
if 10,000 are printed, the cost is 
#$.029 per copy. While other elements 
of printing cost do not decrease so 
markedly as the quantity increases, 
the same principle applies to a lim-

ited extent. Thus the remaining costs 
of paper, presswork, and binding may 
be $400.00 for 1000 copies or $.40 
per copy, and $.31 per copy or $3100 
inv quantities of 10,000 copies: The 
total manufacturing cost per copy of 
this imaginary book is, therefore, 
$1.30 in lots of 1000 copies, and $.40 
per copy in quantities of 10,000 cop- 
ies. Stereotype or electrotype plates 
costing approximately $1.25 per page 
additional have not been included, al- 
though a necessary cost if provision 
is to be made for additional impres- 
sions. 6 


The writer has learned that one 
great university press uses the following 
method of pricing, which bears some re- 
semblance to the Meiner formula: 


Minimum Average 
$1300 $2200 
260 440 
$1560 $2640 
ene 2.935 





5. The formula suggested by Dr. Meiner for pricing this hypothetical book runs as follows: 


Selling price = 


Manufacturing Cost 
1 — (Author's royalty + overhead + profit + retailer's discount) 


The percentages which fill in this formula in ordinary commercial publishing are estimated by 


Bean as follows:

But if the manufacturing cost is $.40, it would be $0 = $1.60 ($#.004 per page). 


Consequently, the book described above, with manufacturing cost of $1.50 in lots of 1000, $.40 in lots 


= $1.50 = $5.20 (#.013 per page) 
225 


6 METHODS OF REPRODUCING RESEARCH MATERIALS 


4. The sales price should then be fixed at 
three times this unit cost of the book 
if the book is to return cost of publi- 
cation and a small royalty to author. 


DS. If this price, considering the final 
appearance of the book, and the aver— 
age price of scholarly publications 
($.022 per page), is so high as to dis- 
courage sales, it must be cut down. 


These figures indicate that even 
when an edition of 1000 is sold, the in- 
come from sales at the normal price of 
€.022 per page will not pay the cost of 
the edition. But the usual sale of a 
scholarly book is less than 1000 copies. 

Mr. Marshall and Mr. Bean made in- 
dependent studies of the normal size of an 
edition of a book written by a scholar for 
Sscwoblars:. Mr. Bean thinks that the aver- 
age first-year sale of a research book is 
between 500 and 600 copies; the average 
first-year sale of books published by uni- 
versity presses between 350 to 600 copies; 
and the ultimate sale from 900 to 1000. 
Mr. Marshall, after studying the histories 
of fifty-nine titles published by learned 
societies between 1925 and 1929, computes” 
the following averages:

These small sales certainly could 
net be Expected to support publication at 
a price per page so nearly normal. Natural- 
ly, the publishing is not self-supporting. 
In fact, the figures show that the expenses 
of manufacture and administration involved 
in the publication of these fifty-nine ti- 
tles ran to $115,000, while the net pro- 
ceeds from sales to apply against these ex- 
penses came only to $41,000 in round num-

bers. The loss was, therefore, $74,000 on 
fifty-nine titles, or $1254 per book. Six- 
ty-four per cent of the money came to these 
publishing projects as a subsidy. This is 
the ratio for publication by the learned 
societies themselves. 

The costs and returns from a typi- 
cal research book are shown in Table II on 
the following page. 

It is to be expected that the 
learned societies would select for publi- 
cation the titles least likely to have a 
wide sale. The general average for scholar- 
ly publication is computed by Mr. Bean to 
stand on a somewhat different level. He 
calculates that the proportion of publica- 
tion cost met by subsidy is 35%. 

It can be concluded that under 
present publishing practices, a sale of 
600 copies will bring in 66% of the cost 
of publication; a sale of 200 copies will 
bring in 33% of the cost of publication; 
and that no book can be expected to get the 
publisher out of the red until after sales 
have passed well beyond the 1000 mark. 

Mr. Cheney's estimates of average 
sales in commercial publishing (which in- 
cludes some scholarly publishing) confirm 
these conclusions. Mr. Cheney finds that 
58% of all fiction titles sell over 3000 
copies, and 19% of all non-fiction, titles 
sell over this amount. Of fiction titles 


the following distribution is normal:

Thus, everything points to ~ the 
marked difference between scholarly and 
commercial publishing economy, because of 
the lack of a wide market for the tools 
and products of research scholarship. 


The Volume of Scholarly Publishing 
Mr. Bean has gathered figures which 


make it possible to put the quantity of 
scholarly book and periodical publishing 
in its financial perspective. The number 
Oi Mm he retin prambedsDOOKS Im Vexi silence 
has been estimated at twenty-four million 
tTioles, "Mr. hichardson of the Library of 
Congress thinks there are eight million of 
these in American libraries. Every year 
approximately 150,000 new titles appear, 
about half of which possess some academic 
interest. Ten thousand of the 150,000 new 
books are published in America, and of 
these possibly one-half possess an element 
of interest to the scholar. But the num— 
ber of works of pure research scholarship 
(including materials and tools of research) 
iS mpl LOSS wee wads, / Wome Os Wels 
American books accessioned by the Library 


of Congress in 1927 shows that in that 
year only 1119 books were published for re- 
search scholars. This count excluded the 
many popularization textbooks and books of 
applied science. 

There are about 20,000 periodicals, 
including newspapers, issued in the United 
States, and of these, according to Mr. 
Bean's calculations, 291 are important re- 
search journals issued by scholars for 
scholars. The output of the total publish— 
ing business in America, according to the 
census of manufacturing, runs to two and a 
haliGe bilson dollars sal year. — bookeand 
pamphlet publishing is conducted at a cost 
of two hundred million dollars. Bucy the 
cost of publishing these 1119 research 
books and 291 research journals is estimat-— 
ed by Mr. Bean at approximately six million 
dollars a year--three and a half million 
LOrEpOoks, sand twowandea haln million for 
journals. Only 1 7/10% of the money spent 
for book and pamphlet publishing goes to 
publish research books and pamphlets. The 
cost of publishing for research scholars 
is only 1/4% of the publishing budget of

the country. It is, therefore, inevitable 
that the main technical and business .de- 
velopments in publishing should follow 
other needs than those of research scholar- 
ship. 

Nevertheless, the scholars are in 
@ position to control their own part of the 
industry, for the funds for scholarly pub- 
lishing are drawn almost exclusively from 
the scholars themselves, being paid direct- 
ly or indirectly by the educational insti- 
LuibLons of thevcountry,. olLxty—fivie per 
cent of the money received for the sale of 
research journals comes from the libraries 
together with the members of the societies 
who are for the most part salaried by the 
educational institutions. But the money 
received from sales does not defray the 
whole cost. In scholarly book publishing, 
35% of the money is received in the form of 
subsidies which are in some cases paid di- 
rectly by the institutions, in other cases 
by authors who are salaried by institu- 
GLONS . 

Here are two great enterprises: 
the publishing trade with an annual budget 
of two and one-half billion dollars, and 
the colleges and universities with an an- 
nual budget of five or six hundred million. 
Their interests overlap in the small item 
Cte six mil vonedollars! = worthvon scholarly 


research publishing. Organized scholarship 
can, if it will, bring this area completely 
under its own control. He who pays the pi- 
per Can call the tune. 


The Scholarly Market 

There are no adequate statistics on 
library expenditures for research books, 
but a few figures are available to indicate 
the scale of library purchasing operations. 
The United States Office of Education re- 
ports that the total annual expenditure for 
books, pamphlets, and periodicals reported 
by public, school, college, and other 1i- 
braries (totaling 5803 libraries) in 1929 
was sixteen million dollars, of which al- 
most fourteen million was spent for books 
published in America.’ In OSI Lainey, 
book-purchasing power was nineteen million 
dollars.? Most of this money is undoubted- 
ly spent on books of little or no scholarly 
interest. Mr. James Thayer Gerould has 
kept records of the sums spent for acquisi- 
tions by forty of the larger university 
and college libraries. His figures, round- 
ed out to thousands of dollars, stand asin 
Table III for the year 1930-31.

PUBLISHING AND LIBRARY COSTS: 


of the largest reference libraries in the 
country, such as the Library of Congress, 
the New York Public Library, or the John 
Cnerar widprary . 

If each of these forty libraries 
buys every one of the research books (1119) 
published in a given year, and subscribes 
to all of the important research periodi- 
cals (291), the total amount carried on 
each budget for the support of American 
scholarly publishing is only $6350 per li- 
brary, or a total of $254,000 toward the 
six-million-dollar publication bill. 

The smaller university libraries 
and the medium or larger college libraries 
must, therefore, be reckoned as the main 
contributors to American scholarly publish- 
ing. Mr. Bean estimates that 975 such li- 
braries are in the market for research 
books. A careful study of the budgets of 
about 200 of these smaller libraries has 
been made by Professor Randall of the Uni- 
versity of Chicago.10 His findings show 
that 205 college libraries spend every year 
for books $964,000; the average amount an- 
nually devoted to book purchase is $3900; 
the average number of books added to the 
library is 1500 titles per year. Mr. Ran- 
dall thinks there are 600 libraries of this 
class. These studies suggest the conclu- 
sion that the lesser college libraries may 
be spending as much as three to four mil- 
lion dollars a year, but that the smaller 
colleges are often unable to provide ade- 
quate library facilities for instruction of 
students, and hence have little margin to 
be used in helping to finance the reproduc- 
tion of research material. 

Aside from the college libraries, 
there are many agencies which in special 
fields may help to defray the costs of 
scholarly publishing with their purchasing 
power. Mr. Franklin F. Holbrook!s study,tt 
compiled under the direction of the Joint 
Committee on Materials for Research, lists 
458 agencies of which only a small propor- 
Plomeare college dibraries, and of which 
many are active in acquiring research ma-— 
terials. Historical societies, law libra- 
ries, and special libraries of all kinds 
round out the institutional market for re- 
search publications. 


THE BOOK Zi 


Aside from the libraries of insti- 
tutions, there is a market for scholarly 
publications among the scholars themselves. 
The Association of University Presses main- 
tains cooperatively on addressograph plates 
an educational directory of 67,000 names, 
distributed about as follows:

These lists are used by the various uni- 
versity presses in circularizing announce- 
ments of books. Presumably they consti- 
tute the active market list. Fifty great 
university and college libraries, a thou- 
sand small ones, several hundred other in= 
Sta tuulons,, and 67,000 scholars=—such is 

the market for scholarly publishing in Amer- 


ica. it is here that the 200 to 600 copies 
of the scholars! research books find their 
sale. 


Library Costs 

The publishing cost and purchase 
price of the book are not the heaviest ex- 
penses that have to be met in making it 
available toa scholar! inva ai bracy. sid 
brary finances must be given a place in the 
total picture, not only because the libra- 
ry is the agency through which the educa- 
tional institutions pay 65% of the sales 
revenue, or 42% of the publishing bill, but 
also because the different methods of re- 
producing materials fit differently into 
the scheme of library finances. 

The money spent by libraries for 
acquisitions is only a small part of the 
cost of maintaining the library system. 
The costs of putting books on the shelves, 
administering them, and housing them are 
greater than the costs of acquiring them. 

The cost analysis of library admin-— 
istration is a disputed field, in which 
the files of the Library Journal report a 
prolonged controversy. The most active 
work in cost analysis has been applied to 
the study of cataloguing cost—-the cost of

putting the book on the shelves. The fig- 
ures which seem best attested are those of 
the University of Californias}. 72" per 
book.: Mr. Paul North Rice, a specialist in 
cooperative cataloguing, thinks that the 
real cost of putting a book on the shelves 
is between $1.50 and $2.00 per volume. Fig- 
ures collected by the government show that 
university libraries spend from 50% to 72% 
or thele funds for other than “acquisition 
purposes. Cornell spends 50%, Yale spends 
72%; the normal amount is about 66%. 

Costs of administration are likely 
to be unusually high when the material 
cared for is not in normal book form. Man- 
uscript and pamphlet collections and col- 
lections of ephemera are often made by li- 
braries without the use of mucn purchase 
money, their cost being principally admin- 
istrative. 

The capital cost of housing a li- 
brary is net included in’ this fieure, since 
land and buildings are not often paid for 
out of current funds. The Cleveland Pub- 
ivewlibrary, wauch pays for ics main bunld— 
ing out of revenue, finds that interest and 
twenty-five-year amortization on a four- 
million-dollar building, for which land was 
donated, take up 39% of the money, leaving 
61% for book purchase and administration. 
If the cost of the land had been charged 
to the library, the percentage of revenue 
devoted to housing would have been nearer 
to 75%. The New York Public Library main- 
tains an enormous investment in land and 
buadiciine si &gt; in iabrarles pon tas tic mci sikh 
increasing quantities of material and num- 
bers of readers may call for the doubling 
of the plant every twenty years, and the 
housing cost may be more than double the 
administrative cost, or four times the cost 
of purchasing books. If a book costs $1.00, 
such a library must spend $2.00 to adminis- 
ter it and $4.00 to house it. A person who 
gives a book to a library under these con- 
ditions is really putting the library to an 
expense that may be six times the value of 
hispeuit. That athis heusine icostacanniors 
be dismissed into the remote future but 
must be accepted as a normal element in li- 
brary financing, is indicated in Mr. Ran- 
dall's study of ninety-four college libra- 
ries. He found that forty-eight of these 
will be filled in ten years, and twenty- 
five within a five-year period. Out of 128 
library buildings, sixty-four report either 











that they are already beyond their working 
capacities so far as stack space as con— 
cerned, or that they will be beyond them 
within ten years. 

What is a normal cost-per-book for 
library buildings? It is often figured 
very roughly at $1.00 per volume; that is 
to say, a million dollars will buy a build- 
ing to house a million volumes. But stack 
room is much cheaper than the building as 
a whole. The president of Snead and Com— 
pany, specialists in library shelving prob- 
lems, estimates the following: 


On the basis of present 
‘prices, library buildings cammbes plu 
UD at.a costuof whromes 20mbo e250 
per cubic foot. Therstackipor ticnior 
a building without the stacks would 
probably cost from one-third to one- 
half of this figure. The equipment 
of the stack room would cost from 
$.30 to $.40 per cubic foot. In 
figuring stack Koon, a Ligure tor 
about two and one-half volumes per 
cubic foot is approximately correct. 


According to these figures, the 
cost of stack room per book would vary from 
€.062 to $.10, but the cost of equipment 
in the stack room would increase this by an 
amount anywhere from $.12 to $.16 per book. 


The total cost per volume stands, therefore, — 


between $.18 and $.26 for stack room only. 
The difference between this figure and the 
"dollar-a-volume" estimate is accounted for 
by the requirements of space for adminis- 
tration, reading, and study. 

Just as the manuscript or pamphlet 
collections cause an abnormally high admin- 
istration cost, so newspaper collections 
cause an extraordinary housing charge. 
Shelving alone costs $1.00 per newspaper 
volume, and the cubie: Toctage or stack 
space needed with the shelving runs this 
cost up to $2.00 or $3.00 per volume. This 
fact has an important bearing on the prob- 
lem of preserving newspaper files, for it 
may be necessary to choose among preserving 
the existing paper stock, making photo- 
lithographic copies in reduced size on per-— 
manent paper, or making microcopies on film 
or glass. By reducing the size of the news- 
paper one-half, housing costs can be cut 
three-fourths or even more. Another point

CHAPTER III 


PRINTED BOOKS 


The publishers of commercially suc- 
cessful books have very little occasion to 
study the cost curve of editions in the 
Peni OMTOe DOO VetulG LS thiserange 
in edition size that library demand and 
scholarly interest indicate as the most im- 
portant in the reproduction of research ma-— 
terials. The cost curve behaves very 
Ssurangely in this) zone, so that the judg— 
ment of busines men acquainted with large- 
editicn printing may be of little value 
here. How can these costs be analyzed most 
clearly, and the respective places of the 
various techniques of book production de- 
termined? 

The stages of book production sepa-— 
rate costs into three primary elements: a 
litre, cos," incurred regardless of the 
suze vor tne: €dition; a "running cost," 
varying with the size of edition; anda 
"reprint cost," incurred when an editionis 
exhausted and a new printing made from 
plates. The reprint cost is independent of

into two very important elements: composi-

costs, which are those that vary with the 
area of paper used in a single copy. Com- 
position costs are found in typewriting 
and wiainotypineswarea cosus are found) san 
some of the pressroom operations. To print 
in large type rather than in small affects 
principally area costs, not composition 
costs, because it means spreading the same

costs paramount elements of first cost. Re-

AND REPRINTS 


saving the stencils. 

The librarian receives as a_ book 
any bound volume, however it may have been 
manufactured. Library shelves give their 
Space to many bound volumes of photostated 
pages (mostly copies of rare books) and 
many bound volumes of typescript (mostly 
theses). Occasionally a bound volume pro- 
duced by the mimeograph finds its way to 
the shelves. In recent years there have 
been a number of books produced by the 
photo-offset method from typescript master 
copies. Many reprints of old books are 
manufactured by photo-offset. Such parvenu 
volumes, invading the library shelves, are 
regarded with no little contempt by the ex- 
ponents of established printing press prod- 
ucts already in possession. How far are 
these different techniques suitable for the 
production of books? How is the field to 
be allotted among them? 

Here it is necessary to note that 
the book itself is challenged, even in the 
library. The vertical file, housing an ar- 
ray of unbound memoranda, pamphlets, propa- 
ganda matter, broadsides, and other materi- 
als, some of permanent value and some 
ephemeral, has come into the library refer- 
ence room to take business away from the 
bookshelves. And now from another quarter 
comes the possible development of reduced 
copies on film of material to be read by 
projection, threatening the books with more 
serious technological unemployment. Not 
only the ordinary printed book of the con- 
ventional form, but even the book itself is 
placed in a competitive position where it 
once possessed a monopoly. Lt will require 
no little care to make sure that competi- 
tion between the book and its rivals is 
regulated in the best interests of scholar- 
Siar 

The starting point of an analysis 
of the. technological problem of book pro- 
duction is a fundamental distinction to be 
made between two types of cost behavior, 
instanced by the photostat+:on the one hand,

which the cost per copy fell as the size of

convenience all those techniques which op- 
erate on a cost system resembling printing 
will be analyzed first, and those tech-— 
niques which operate on or near a pre- 
Gutenberg cost basis will be analyzed lat- 
er. 

Of the techniques operating on the 
system resembling printing (i.e., with a 
substantial distinction between first costs 
and running costs), several classifications 
are possible. The one that will probably 
appeal to scholars as the most natural 
would distinguish between those techniques 
which produce a book printed in the kind of 
book type with which they are familiar, and 
those which produce a book printed in type- 
SGI G. 

Of the techniques yielding a prod- 
uct in print-face type, there are two that 
are available for putting new material into 
book form: these are printing from raised 
type on a flat-bed cylinder press, and 
printing from raised type on a multigraph- 
ing machine. Two other techniques are 
available for making new books from photo- 
graphs of old ones. These are the photo- 
offset method, which has many names, and 
the "dermaprint" method. The photo-offset 
process works from a negative photographic 
copy to a metal printing surface, the derm- 
aprint from a positive photographic copy to 
a mimeograph stencil surface. 

There are also four techniques for 
making books in typescript face. Among 
them the leading place belongs to photo- 
offset, but room must also be found for the 
mimeograph, hectograph, and even the hum- 
ble carbon paper. These techniques will be 
discussed in a later chapter. This pres-— 
enhuanalysius. is imitted to the discussion 
of making books in ordinary print type from 





one of two kinds of copy--a manuscript that 
is being converted into a new book, and an 
old book that is being reprinted. 


Printing with Raised Type on Cylinder Press= 
es. 





From the time of John Gutenberg un- 
til that of Ottmar Mergenthaler, the proc- 
ess of printing remained fundamentally the 
same. Separate types, laboriously set up 
by hand, were used to make impressions 
upon paper or other substances. With the 
invention of the typesetting and typecast- 
siales WieKelalainaleys; alia, late) iaimvalerneisiniclal Cxevanicibney 
however, a revolution in printing methods 
was effected. 

The most common typesetting 
chines, remarkable in their ingenious 
mechanism, are the linotype, invented by 
Mergenthaler, and the intertype, built upon 
the mechanical principles devised by him. 
These machines, which produce the greater

in which is cast the complete line in one

edge, properly spaced and justified. The 
Ludlow Typograph, another slug-casting ma- 
chine, is used chiefly for display work. 
The monotype, invented by Tolbert Lanston, 
casts individual types in the correct order 
and automatically transfers them to a gal- 
ley in justified lines. 

The type as cast by the compositor 
is arranged in long columns. These must 
be proofread and "made-up," that is to say, 
divided into pages and arranged in forms 
in such a-way that the printed sheet, when 
folded, will page correctly. 

The printing is then done on a

on the flat surface, with its thousands of

10 POINT CENTURY 


THE “RED DEATH” had long devastated the country. 
No pestilence had ever been so fatal, or so hideous. 
Blood was it Avatar and its seal—the redness and 
the horror of blood. There were sharp pains, and sud- 
den dizziness, and then profuse bleeding at the pores, 
with dissolution. The scarlet stains upon the body 
and especially upon the face of the victim, were the 
pest ban which shut him out from the aid and from 
the sympathy of his fellow-men. And the whole seiz- 
ure, progress and termination of the disease, were 
the incidents of half an hour. But the Prince Pros- 
pero was happy and dauntless and sagacious. When 
his dominions were half depopulated, he summoned 
to his presence a thousand hale and light-hearted 
friends from among the knights and dames of his 
court, and with these retired to the deep seclusion of 
one of his castellated abbeys. This was an extensive 
and magnificent structure, the creation of the 
prince’s own eccentric yet august taste. A strong and 
lofty wall girdled it in. This wall had gates of iron. 
The courtiers, having entered, brought furnaces and 
massy hammers and welded the bolts. They resolved 
to leave means neither of ingress nor egress to the 
sudden impulses of despair or of frenzy from within. 
The abbey was amply provisioned. With such pre- 
cautions the courtiers might bid defiance to conta-

the mean time it was folly to grieve, or to think. The

AN ECONOMICAL PRINT-FACE FORMAT 


In order to secure an economical print-face format, various factors must be 
taken into consideration. Among these are the compactness and size of the 
type-face, the amount of leading, and the width of the margins. 

In discussing type-sizes and type-faces, it may be well to know of the grad- 
uated or uniform scale for measuring type which is now used by American 
type-founders. This scale is known as the point system. The unit of the sys- 
tem is a division of space called a point, which is .013837 or Ye of an inch. 
All type sizes are multiples of this unit of measurement. The smallest type 
generally used is 5-point or Pearl. 6-point or Nonpareil and 8-point or Bre- 
vier are frequently used for footnotes in monographic work. 7-point or 
Minion is commonly used for newsprint. 1o-point or Long Primer is best 
suited for regular book composition. Examples of these type-sizes can con- 
veniently be found by looking under “type” in Webster's International Dic- 
tionary of the English Language. The use of a type-size smaller than 10-point 
effects an economy in make-up and make-ready but not in composition, for 
a given manuscript will require approximately the same number of “ems” 
in various sizes of type. 

As a given font of type has an exact point-size in its depth, so the individual 
characters of that font have a definite width of “set.” The average width of 
the character “m” in a type-face is as great as its depth; in a word, the letter 
“m” is exactly square. This is the case in commonly used type-faces like Cas- 
lon Old Style, Scotch Roman and Modern, where in 10-point the set size of 
the letter “m” is also 10 points. In a compact type-face, like the one used for 
this composition, the set size of the letter “m” is only 94 points, with all other 
characters having a corresponding compactness. By the use of this type-face, 
known as Granjon, a considerable saving can be effected in composition costs 
if these are reckoned up by multiplying the width by che length of the line. 
If composition costs are determined by the number of key-strokes instead of 
the amount of type matter, this type-face would effect a saving not in com- 
position costs, but in area costs only. 

Excessive leading is not compatible with good value in book-making, and 
should be prevented, if possible, by instructions by the publisher to the printer. 
The type of this page is leaded one point; in a word, 11-point type is cast 
on a 12-point body. 

Much space is often wasted in margins. The formula for margins given by 
Gress’ calls for top and back margin to be equal; the outside to be equal 
to the top plus one-third of the back margin; and the bottom to be equal to 
the outside margin plus two picas (or about one-fourth inch). This formula 
is followed in the format here illustrated. 

This page format has been designed by the R. R. Donnelley &amp; Sons Com- 
pany of Chicago as one taking account of the economies possible in page

Sample Page to Illustrate Letterpress Format on 634"x91/9” Page 


AN ECONOMICAL PRINT-FACE FORMAT 


A two-column page is economical because 
it permits a fuller utilization of the page size. 
The width of the margins can be decreased 
without loss of proportion, while the size of 
type can be reduced without serious loss of 
legibility. Thus the word content of a page 
can be very materially increased. 

In constructing a two-column page format, 
the relationship between the line length and 
the type-size as a factor affecting legibility is 
an important consideration. The most signif- 
icant work in establishing this relationship 
has been done by M. A. Tinker and D. G. 
Paterson at the University of Minnesota. In a 
series of articles in the Journal of Applied Psy- 
chology their experimental investigations are 
described. In the April 1929 issue on pages 
120-130 is found a report in regard to the 
“Size of Type.” After experimenting with 
6, 8, 10, 12, and 14 points of type, Paterson 
and Tinker concluded that “10 point type 
yields the fastest reading and is thus the opti- 
mum size of type for efficient reading.” They 
also pointed out, in the course of their discus- 
sion, that “one is seldom justified in reducing 
printing space to such a degree that speed of 
reading is markedly decreased.” In the June 
1929 issue on pages 205-19 Paterson and 
Tinker report on the “Length of Line.” 
After investigating texts in 10-point type in 
59, 80, 97, 114, 136, 152,168, and 186 mm. 
line lengths, they believe the conclusion is 
justified that “for 10 point type, an 80 mm. 
(or 19 pica) line yields the fastest reading 
and is therefore the optimum length of line 
for efficient reading.” In the February 1931 
issue on pages 72-78, Tinker and Paterson 
report on the “Simultaneous Variation of 
Type and Line Length.” They investigated 
the legibility of 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14 point 
types set in line lengths, proportionally in- 
creased or decreased from 10-point on 19 
picas. Thus 6-point was set in a 16 pica, 8- 
point in a 17 pica, 10-point in a 19 pica, 12- 
point in a 23 pica, and 14-point in a 27 pica 
line. Their conclusions are the following: 

The results obtained in this experiment seem to 


justify the conclusion that line for line arrangements 
varying from a standard text printed in 10 point with 


an optimal line length of 19 picas yield equally efh- 
cient reading performance for 8 and 10 point type, 
and possibly for larger sizes. The evidence shows that 
6 point type with line length reduced as stated is 
read at a significantly slower rate. 

The experiment yields evidence that, within cer- 
tain limits, neither size of type nor line length as 
single variables can be relied upon in determining 
optimal typographical arrangements. Both factors 
(and perhaps others as well) work hand in hand 
and must be properly balanced to produce a printed 
page which will promote the maximum reading rate. 

The typescript pages of this book are ar- 
ranged in a two-column format with a line 
length approximating the optimal line length 
for 10-point type. Since it is difficult to find 
the typescript equivalent of 10-point type, it 
is not possible to determine whether the type- 
script size used in this book will yield the 
tastest reading, but it is likely that it ap- 
proaches the optimum size of type for effi- 
cient reading. 

This double-column format in print-face 
has a printing surface of 5% x 7% inches, 
with line lengths of 15 picas. The type-size 
used is 10-point for the regular composition 
and 8-point for the two paragraphs of quo- 
tation. The type-face is Granjon. It has been 
possible to prepare this page through the 
courtesy of the R. R. Donnelley &amp; Sons Com- 
pany of Chicago. 

A two-coluinn page is economical because 
it permits a fuller utilization of the page size. 
The width of the margins can be decreased 
without loss of proportion, while the size of 
type can be reduced without serious loss of 
legibility. Thus the word content of a page 
can be very materially increased.

Printing: Composition Costs 


In printing from raised type on 
flat-bed cylinder presses, composition 
costs form a major item of expense in the 
manufacture of a book. To be sure, the 
composing machines, by increasing the speed 
and accuracy of composition, have reduced 
its cost, so that hand-set type, when used 
in straight textual matter, has become a 
luxury. But the elaborate mechanism neces— 
sary for casting type makes the cost of 
the machines so high (from $4000 to $8000) 
that a heavy overhead charge is necessary. 
The all-inclusive cost per chargeable hour 
for the operation of the machines range 
from $3.00 to $5.00. The composite aver- 
age for print shops in the United States in 
1932 was $3.927, according to the United 
Typothetae of America. The composite for 
monotype keyboard operation was $3.466, and 
for the monotype caster $2.858. These fig- 
ures include all factory expenses, commer- 
cial and selling expenses, overhead, and 
the wages of skilled compositors, which 
Porme45% sof the total. In estimating 
cost of composition, a standard unit of 
TeOCRemseis used; thatois, the amount: of 
text that will occupy the lineage of a 
thousand of the letter m, or, to be more 
accurate, the square of any particular type 
size. If the number of ems per word is 
calculated at four, there would be 250 
words per 1000 ems. Since a compositor 
will set from 3000 to 5000 ems per hour, 
the cost of machine composition, reckoning 
on the basis of $3.00 to $5.00 per machine 
hour, would run between $2.40 and $6.65 per 
1000 words. 

Theoretically, the amount of compo- 
sition is determined by multiplying the 
number of ems in one line by the number of 
lines set. It is the general trade prac-— 
tice, however, in measuring up type for the 
purpose of finding the cost of composition, 
to include headings, leads, slugs, etc., as 
composed lines.® Thus the number of ems in 
‘the page is found by multiplying the width 
by the length of the line. The author,

in 10-point type on ll-point body, 


The majority of books appear 
the 





majority of newspapers in 6 1/2-point or 
7-point type on 7-point body. For each ad- 
ditional point of leading the author ordi- 
narily pays about 10% more in composition. 
It is questionable whether legibility de- 
mands more than one point of lead between 
lines. Certainly types like Caslon Old 
Style, with its long descenders, can be 
sparsely leaded without suffering in legi- 
oat elisingts yas 

Composition costs can be controlled 
in some measure by using a compact type 
face. Most of the commonly used type faces, 
like Caslon Old Style, Scotch Roman and Mod- 
ern, have a set corresponding to the face 
Size, ulabeils, an em ol these type faces is 
square; others, like Binny Old Style and 
Century Expanded, are used at a slightly 
wader seu; whiikevothers, slike Bruce Old 
Style, Kennerley, Garamond, and Granjon, are 
cast on a Slightly narrower set. Thus a 
page of a certain number of ems of Granjon 
would contain 7% to 10% more words than a 
corresponding page with the same number of 
ems of Century Expanded, as is obvious by 
comparing the word content of Figure I. 
Two economical print-face formats are shown 
in hieures il and int 

The difference in words per 1000 
ems between a compact and expanded type 
face, plus the difference between minimal 


‘and excessive leading, may make an appre- 


Ciable difference in composition costs for 
a book of a few hundred pages, perhaps as 
much as 10% or 20%. 

Most of the printing done in Amer- 
ica is newsprinting. The American public 
reads more words in newsprint than in any 
other form. The publication of scholarly 
books, if estimated in number of ems, or 
area of pages, or tonnage of paper and size 
of edition, is almost negligible in compar- 
ison with the corresponding newsprint fig- 
ures. Yet books, in general, are printed 
in larger type than newspapers, and with a 
layout that devotes a much larger propor- 
tion of the page area to margins. News-— 
print in two-inch columns, as standardized 
in the American press, is certainly a for— 
mat of remarkable cheapness and efficiency. 

As a factor increasing composition 
costs, corrections and alterations deserve 
particular attention. From a description 





e. Some firms, like R. R. Donnelley and Sons Company, have adopted the scientific method of measuring 
composition by computing the actual number of ems set.

of the typesetting machines, especially the 
linotype and intertype, it is obvious that 
making corrections in the matter already 
set up is a costly operation, because each 
error requires the substitution of an en- 
tire line. With the monotype, corrections 
are somewhat cheaper, for only a single 
letter, already cast, need be substituted. 

After composition has been made to 
correspond to the copy, all changes subse- 
quently made by the author or his publish- 
er, whether in the text or in the arrange— 
ment of paragraphs, are considered as 
author's alterations and are charged 
against him. Not infrequently the author 
is presented with a bill for his altera- 
tions almost equaling that of the original 
composition costs. Author's alterations 
are usually charged on the basis of time 
at the rate of about $2.00 to $4.00 per 
hour, varying with the wage scale, and 
higher when made by machine than when made 
by hand. In some cases alterations are 
billed on a unit basis with standard unit 
prices for changes, which enable the cus-

free allowance, possibly 10% above the 
original composition, is made by the print- 
er for author's alterations, whicn means 
simply that this factor has been figured 
into the original bid. 

Author's corrections would be en- 
tirely unnecessary if the author would de- 
vote the same attention to the preparation 
of copy as he would to making a master copy 
for photo-offset, and be equally satisfied 
to accept this as a final form. By delib- 
erately preparing a manuscript which would

the author would contribute to a low cost 
level in ordinary printing in the same way, 
though in a less degree, as by taking upon 
himself the making of the master copy for 
the photo-offset process. Some editors af- 
firm that authors are so given to habits of 
carelessness that reform in this respect is 
possible only by changing human nature.

The fundamental unit of all area

THE “Rep DEATH” had long devastated the country. No 
pestilence had ever been so fatal, or so hideous. Blood 
was its Avatar and its seal—the redness and the horror 
of blood. There were sharp pains, and sudden dizziness, 
and then profuse bleeding at the pores, with dissolution. 
The scarlet stains upon the body and especially upon the 
face of the victim, were the pest ban which shut him out 
from the aid and from the sympathy of his fellow-men. 
And the whole seizure, progress and termination of the 
disease, were the incidents of half an hour. But the 
Prince Prospero was happy and dauntless and sagacious. 
When his dominions were half depopulated, he sum- 
moned to his presence a thousand hale and light-hearted 
friends from among the knights and dames of his court, 
and with these retired to the deep seclusion of one of his 
castellated abbeys. This was an extensive and magnifi- 
cent structure, the creation of the prince’s own eccentric 
yet august taste. A strong and lofty wall girdled it in. 
This wall had gates of iron. The courtiers, having en- 
tered, brought furnaces and massy hammers and welded 
the bolts. They resolved to leave means neither of in- 
gress nor egress to the sudden impulses of despair or of 
frenzy from within. The abbey was amply provisioned. 
With such precautions the courtiers might bid defiance 
to contagion. The external world could take care of 
itself. In the mean time it was folly to grieve, or to 
think. The prince had provided all the appliances of 
pleasure. There were buffoons, there were improvisatori, 
there were ballet-dancers, there were musicians, there 
was Beauty, there was wine. All these and security were

But first let me tell of the rooms in which it was held. There 
were seven—an imperial suite. In many palaces, however, such 
suites form a long and straight vista, while the folding-doors 
slide back nearly to the walls on either hand, so that the view 
of the whole extent is scarcely impeded. Here the case was very 
different; as might have been expected from the prince’s love of 
the bizarre. The apartments were so irregularly disposed that the 
vision embraced but little more than one at a time. There was a 
sharp turn at every twenty or thirty yards, and at each turn a 
novel effect. To the right and left, in the middle of each wall, a 
tall and narrow Gothic window looked out upon a closed cor- 
ridor which pursued the windings of the suite. These windows 
were of stained glass whose colour varied in accordance with

The number of pages, and hence the number 
of forms, required will vary with the point 
size of the type, the compactness of the 
type, and the amount of leading. 

An important difference is to be 
noted in the effect upon costs of faces 
and compactness of type on the one hand, 
eau poLnt, size onthe other. True it is 
that resort to compact type faces and light 
leading will mean fewer pages and hence 
fewer forms than extended faces and heavy 
leading. But the greatest difference in 
area costs is a resultant-of two other fac-— 
tors--the proportion of paper given to text 
as compared with the proportion given: to 
margins, and the point size of type. These 
elements of cost, more than any others, are 
likely to be related most directly to the

According to Vernon, ® ine Vom eso) 
great variation in legibility between 6- 
point type and 10-point type. Readers and 
reviewers, however, often express prefer- 
ence for the larger type sizes, and their 
preferences, even if they be regarded as 
the results of habit rather than the con- 
sequences of the physiology of vision, must 
be taken into account by a publisher. How 
far it is wise to let considerations of 
economy in area costs bring about the use 
of the smaller type sizes must be calcu- 
lated by comparing two quantities: namely, 
the percentage of cost saving that can be 
effected by shifting from the largest to 
the smallest type, and the sacrifice of 
legibility or beauty that results from such 
CMe Stiietntie 

How rapidly will area costs fall if 
type size is reduced? Consider a 6" x Qn" 
page, with a printing surface 4 1/2" 

x 7 1/2", printed with 32-page forms. News- 
print in two columns with half an inch be- 
tween them would yield 800 pages, 24,600 
words per form (according to an actual 
count of words). Eight-point type, leaded 
one point would put 25,000 words on a form; 
1O0-point type in the same type face, lead- 
ed one point, would put 17,500 words on a 
form. Figure IV shows the increase in word 


content per page that is made possible by 
shifting from 10-point Bodoni type to 8- 
point Bodoni, both being leaded one point. 
The shift from 10-point to 8-point type 
one- 


would save one form out of three, or 











third of the area cost in a text of 50,000 
words, 


Printings Running Costs 


Running costs are not decisive in 
small editions. The difference between

have an overprint, which can be left in

ditional cost. Even with books of larger 
editions this procedure is followed. The 
Encyclopedia Britannica, for example, is

lots of 2500 only. Electrotypes are made 
which are preserved for further printing, 
and the type is kept standing for making 
corrections and for making new electro- 
types. 





As the size of the edition increases 
to the point where composition and make- 
ready costs begin to be balanced by the 
cost of materials and running time in the 
press, the established conceptions covering 
book costs become operative. Many of the 
great inventions in the printing world 
since the Linotype have been devices of one 
kind or another for getting the printing 
surface on a cylinder and off the flat-bed, 
so that faster running and longer runs 
would be possible. This is the story of 
the stereotype,.cast from a matrix, and of 
the electrotype, resulting from coating an 
impression in wax electrolytically with 
copper. But they have no place in the cal- 
culations of costs of small editions.

. Loose type, milled linotype slugs, special monotype composition, automatically embossed aluminum type 


strips or curved plates or electrotypes are mounted on the printing cylinder by sliding them into 
fixed grooves. Loose type, which is the most commonly used, is set semi-automatically by hand or with 
a typesetting machine operated with typewriter control. As in the case of typewriting, the right-hand 
margins come out uneven, unless they are justified by hand or with special adjustable spacers. The 
type is obtainable in a wide variety of sizes and standard print-faces, and costs $.80 for typewriter 
styles, 6.95 for print styles, for a box containing on an average 25,000 characters, printing about 
415 words; it is scrapped after using. It is sometimes mounted on a flexible blanket which may easily 
be attached to or removed from a smooth-faced segment. The embossed strips are always mounted on a 
similar sort of blanket. The most popular multigraph prints only one 8 1/2" x 11" page at a time, but 
a machine is manufactured with a drum large enough for two 8 1/2" x 11" pages; this is fairly common.

has been made by Mimeoform Press, 1320 F Street, 
N. W., Washington, D. C., under the direction of 
Mr. Ernest Kletsch, who styles his process the Mimeo-

PRINTED BOOKS 


printing to the purpose of book production 
has been made by the Mimeoform Service un- 
der the direction of Dr. Ernest Kletsch, 
who styles his process the mimeoform proc- 
ess. He uses a Lanston Monotype for set- 
ting the type, which is cast in a low type 
mold, 8-, 10-, or 12-point. A special 
caster (the only part of his equipment that 
may not be found in almost any establish- 
ment supplying multigraph shops with compo- 
sition) automatically delivers the line of 
short type, properly spaced and justified, 
to the channels of the multigraph drum. 
When the drum is filled, the caster auto- 
matically stops. It takes only half a min- 
ute to fit the drum to the multigraph ma- 
Chine, and the printing can begin. Proof- 
reading is done immediately, and correc- 
tions are quickly made from the case of 
type. 

There are certain defects in the 
appearance of the finished mimeoform prod- 
uct. Within the range of type sizes from 
6-point to 12-point, all the type faces 
available for monotype composition are 
available for multigraph composition, and 
pages are produced by the multigraph with 
all the features of print-face, such as 
Justified lines, italics, bold-face, etc. 
But the appearance of the printed page 
sometimes displays certain imperfections. 
As the type is transferred to the channels 
of the-drum, it occasionally slips up or 
down or slightly awry. This results not 
only in a poor alignment of type, but in 
some cases in an indistinct impression. In 
general, the product of the mimeoform does 
not approach the highest quality of the 
flat-bed cylinder press. 

Amina ta plone is norma tease ales OmuebO 
be noticed. The space between the channels 
on the multigraph drum, into which the 
short type is transferred by the caster, is 
fixed, permitting not more than six lines 
to the inch, regardless of size of type. 
Thus all four type sizes available (6-, 8-, 
10-, and 12-point) are cast on a 12-point 
body (note Figure VI, set in 12-point and 
8-point type). This means that lines of 


AND REPRINTS ae) 
10-point type, the most commonly used for 
book composition, would be leaded two 
points; 8-point type, four points; and 6- 
point type, used for footnotes, six points. 
For spacing between paragraphs, a channel 
of the drum would be left empty. In 10- 
point composition the loss in compactness 
over ordinary composition leaded one point 


‘is about 30%, and this percentage increases 


as the size of the type decreases. The waste 
of space is particularly great in footnote 
work. The effect of this wastage of paper 
area can be neutralized by using the full 
surface of the drum and printing upon a 
large page, 81/2" x 11". Running costs 
are the same for this large page as for a 
smaller one, and indeed, in the writer's 
opinion, the best possible format for mimeo- 
form work is an 8 1/2" x 11" page set in 
10-point type in two columns (Figure VII). 
One further limitation of the multi- 
graph as a book-printing device must be 
mentioned: it is quite unsuited to any 
publishing in which illustrative material 
is to be put on the same page with textual 
matter. Although it is possible to incor- 
porate line cuts or coarse screen half 
tones in a page of matter produced on the 
multigraph by purchasing small curved elec-— 
trotypes of the illustrative material, the 
cost is such that it is more economical to 
use some other process--e.g., photo-offset 
--for highly illustrated text. On the 
other hand, if illustrations are on sepa- 
rate pages, the multigraph is well suited 
to their use, because they do not have to 
be interleaved in signatures but can be 
gathered for binding like any other pages. 
The mimeoform process of multigraph 
printing is useful for the production of 
scholarly books when the edition is in the 
region of 100 to 500. Considerable sav- 
ings over. ordinary printing are here ef- 
fected because composition costs are re- 
duced, in some measure, by wage-scale fac-— 
tors and by the very difficulty of making 
author's corrections which tends to en- 
force upon authors practices that would be 
equally effective in reducing printing costs. 


6. Other names for similar multigraph services are Mimeo-Gravure and Mimeo-Photo. 
7. The multigraph interferes somewhat with the working habit of scholars who expect to receive proofs of 


a 300-page book, leave them on the desk for a week, and correct them when they "get to it." 


The 


Mimeoform Service does not at present have the equipment for holding so many pages in type pending sub-

Area costs are held down because make-up is 
eliminated, being combined with typesetting, 
and because there is no make-ready, and it 
is in area costs that the principal savings 
occur. Running costs are higher in propor- 
tion than printing press running costs be- 
cause each page is run separately; for that 
reason, printing will always catch up with 
and pass mimeoform, if the edition is large 
enough; but in the reslon voit i00 tron S00.

Alternatives to Printing 

Litem cece tmp le LUmem tia be pirG— 
ing presents to the scholar. If the prob- 
lems of scholarly publishing are not met at 
this cost level, the alternative to be stud-— 
ied is the use of typescript reproduced by 
photo-offset, the mimeograph or hectograph, 
or by some photographic process. Of these, 
photo-offset is the most frequently applied 
to book production. The first use of these 
processes is found in bringing back into 
print materials already available in print- 
ed form; but they can also be used for pub- 
lishing new matter from typescript. How- 
ever, these processes can be most clearly 
analyzed as devices for reprinting, and 
they will therefore be described in that 
connection. 


Reprinting: the Photo-offset Process 

The process known as photolithogra- 
phy, photo-offset, lithoprinting, offset 
printing, planograph printing, and a number 
of trade or firm names, has developed in 
the last thirty years from the combined ap- 
plication of the principles of lithography 
and photography, together with a new type 
of printing press. 

Lithography was developed by apply- 
ing the principle that grease repels water, 
Ditteaboraccs a greasy ink. The process wails 
discovered in 1796 by Alois Senefelder of 
Munich, who used the limestone of Solen- 
hofen, Bavaria, which was especially good 
for absorbing water and taking grease. A 
stone surface was covered with the greasy 
marks of a lithographic pencil, then mois- 
tened and then inked. The ink would adhere 
to the pencil marks, avoid the moistened 
spaces, and transfer to paper as a litho- 
graphic print. This direct method from 
stone to paper necessitated the image to be 
drawn or imposed on the stone in reverse. 

The same principle is applied in 
the photo-offset process, which is fundamen- 
tally lithographic in character. A photo- 
graphic image is transferred, via a nega- 
tive, to a metal plate covered with a light- 








sensitive emulsion (albumen with ammonium 
bichromate). An exposure to an are light 
hardens the portions of the emulsion under 
the transparent parts of the negative so 
that they remain on the plate after develop- 
ment as an image of the copy to be repro- 
duced. Thus. the process is photographic. A 
sample sheet of the negative (Figure VIII) 
and a sample piece of a used metal sheet 
from the multilith (Figure IX) are bound 
herewith. 

The emulsion image is of such a 
character that it is receptive to greasy 
ink. The plate, therefore, may be placed 
upon a press which moistens it (the mois- 
ture adheres to the parts of the plate not 
carrying the hardened emulsion) and inks it 
(the greasy ink avoids the moistened sur- 
faces of the plate, but sticks to the emul- 
Sion image). The printing surface is flat; 
it has no raised surfaces like type faces, 
no sunken intaglios; hence the name "plano- 
ra wwce 

The third element of the process is 
the offset press. The first practical off- 
set press, upon which flat-surface metal 
plates could be used, was developed in 
1906. A few years earlier Ira W. Rubel, a 
lithographer of Nutley, New Jersey, con- 
ceived the idea of developing an offset 
press while watching a feeder operate a 
cylinder press. When the feeder missed a 
sheet, as sometimes happens, there was 
made on the tympan sheet an impression 
which offset on the back of the next sheet 
and produced a better print than the one 
Rubel was getting by direct impression. He 
thereupon developed an offset press in 
which a reversed image was printed by the 
flat-surfaced plate on a rubber blanket, 
from which the wet impression was offset on 
the paper sheet. It is this last feature 
which has given the whole process its name 
of “offset printing. "8 

For scholarly publication, two 
small offset presses, the "rotaprint" and 
the multilith (Figures X and XI), which 
are used by business offices doing small 


8. The two elements of the process--the photographic preparation of a metal printing surface and the use 


of a rubber blanket to "offset" the impression—-are not necessarily and indissolubly connected. 


There 


is one press, the Schwarze Presse or Coxhead Press, which brings the metal printing surface directly 


in contact with the paper. 


It is planographic in the sense that the printing surface is a plane, 


photographic in that the surface is prepared by photographic means, but it is not an offset process. 
The Schwarze or Coxhead process also differs from most planographic processes in that no negative is 


used in transferring an image to the metal. 
the image burned with an arc light.

runs of advertising matter or publishing a 
house organ, deserve special attention. 
When soliciting business, the users of the 
large offset presses regard these smaller 
units as little better than office appli- 
ances; the users of the small presses chal- 
lenge this judgment. But in the presence 
of the NRA the large offset press people 
tried to make rotaprint and multilith come 
into the Graphic Arts Code, while they held 
out on the claim of being merely office ap- 
pliances. Examples of their work will en- 
able the reader to judge of their relative 
quality (see Figures XXV and XXVI in Chap- 
ter V). This volume is planographed with 

a Harris press (Figure XII), which has also 
been used in reproducing pictures in the 
chapter on illustrations. 


Photo-Offset: Composition Costs 
The composition of the text from 


which the photographic negative is produced 
is not actually part of the photo-offset 
process: in preparing a new book by photo- 
offset, either ordinary raised type compo- 
sition or typewriting would be used, and 
the factors affecting these costs are else- 
where discussed. If ordinary linotype com- 
position were resorted to with this proc- 
ess, no saving would be possible unless a 
considerable number of illustrations ap- 
peared; the production of typescript books 
by photo-offset will be examined in Chapter 
Vile 

In the present discussion photo- 
offset is being considered as a reprinting 
Gevice, and in. thescase of a reprint ef a 
book by this process, there is actually no 
composition whatever, the old book serving 
as master copy for the photographic part of 
the process.

photography. This technique came to the 
photo-offset shop from the photoengraver. 
The photoengraver would coat a sheet of 
glass with albumen, collodion, and nitrate 
of silver in the order named, thus making a 
"wet plate." This wet plate would go into 
the camera and be developed and fixed as a 
photographic negative. It would then have 
its surface strengthened by applications of 
a liquid rubber solution and collodion. The 
result would be a "sandwich" of the photo- 
graphic silver image between two sheets of 
collodion adhering to the glass plate. Then 
the photoengraver would soak off the sand- 
wich with a bath of acetic acid and use it 
as a negative in preparing the metal sheet 
printing surface. More recently it has be- 
come the practice to use film rather than 
wet plate at this stage of the process, and 
now paper negative is taking the place of 
film for some kinds of work ees liemcos vane 
lationships of these three photographic 
media are approximately: 


Paper negative .... 1 
Hem Mee at al Vi urenstelemsmme) 
Wet plate 


When the material to be copied is of maxi- 
mum legibility, with ample contrast between 
its black and white, the paper negative 
(Photostat N-26, Kodalith, Contrasto Poly- 
graphic Company's product or Haloid Com— 
pany's Litholoid) is wholly satisfactory. 
According to an estimate made for the Joint 
Committee, the paper negatives required in 
preparing metal sheets for a book of 128 
pages, 6" x 9", would cost G5-i2.55 12 ue 
were used, the cost of the films would be 
$17.92. Thus a variation of $12.80,-0r ap— 
proximately 10% of a job priced at about 
$125.00 (exclusive of binding and paper 
costs) is controlled by the choice of film 
or paper negatives. On the other hand, 
when the copy is poor the photo-offset 
printer may be forced to use a wet plate 
negative.?

given him for the purpose, can prepare the 
paper negatives. The situation may bring 
about a separation of the photographic costs 
from the strictly photo-offset costs. The 
trade does not usually work on this basis, 
but figures received from several sources 
indicate that a discount of 18% to 30% can 
be given if satisfactory paper negatives 
are provided to the photolithographer.19 
Dnotwenr basis ter calculating this cost is 
found in the difference between the origi- 
nal and reprint quotations when the photo- 
lithographer has preserved the negatives 
for the book, but not the metal sheets. 
This discount when given runs near to 15%. 


(b) The Preparation of the Metal Plate 
However, in computing area ‘costs, 
the preparation of the metal plate is a 
more important factor than the making of 
the photographic negatives. The price per 





area of photo-offset printing surface has 
been calculated by Fred W. Hoch, author of 
the Standard Book of Estimating for Print- 
ers, and published in the American Printer 
for June, 1932 (p. 55), as follows. Accord- 
ing to information recently received, these 
DENCE Seno moda mE GOMe EOS eC sim oT Tes maint 
appears that the price of photo-offset 
printing surface should be somewhere be- 
tween $2.14 and $2.41 per 100 square inches. 
These figures agree roughly with those ob- 
tained from certain firms in 19433 and with 
quotations obtained in 1931. 


(c) Full Utilization of Metal Plate Sur- 
face 
Since the printing surface of the 
metal plates constitutes the most important 
factor in the determination of area costs, 
photo-offset work pages should be planned

It resembles Kodalith paper except that the thin emulsion can be 
stripped dry off the paper base and transferred to the metal for the burning—in process. 


The emulsion 


stripped from the stripping paper is so much thinner than film or Kodalith paper that it is said to 
make a clearer image in the burning-in process and is therefore comparable to the wet plate in fine- 


ness. 


This paper is available in Germany at the firms of von Bayer in Leverkusen, Koln; the Mimosa— 


A.G., Dresden, Schandauerstrasse; the Baltische Papier-fabrik, Berlin, N. W. 7, Dorotheenstrasse 38. 
The typon paper can also be used for making negatives for photo-offset work without photograph-— 

ic apparatus, as in reflection copying; the paper is laid on top of the original to be copied, exposed 

10-20 seconds, developed by means of a special developer, and fixed, as usual. After drying, the emul- 


sion is stripped from a stripping paper. 
ably reduced. 


Through this process the cost of the negatives is consider— 
Many books such.as lexicons, law books, etc., are printed by this method. 


Photographic apparatus is being manufactured by Hoh un Hahne of Leipzig, Germany, which will 


produce negatives of book pages for photo-offset work at a great speed: 


it is apparatus with self-— 


acting bellows or dark slide, automatic shutters for exposure, and devices for the proper pagination 


and placing of the book.

a4 METHODS OF REPRODUCING RESEARCH MATERIALS 


This raises the question of the relation of 
pege, plate, and press sizes. 

There are on the market some eighty 
different sizes of offset presses, using 


metal sheets of eighty different dimensions. 


Yet such is the force and pressure of 
standardization in the trade that most op- 
erators will aver that all these variant 
sizes are best adapted to the two standard 
page sizes, 6" x 9", and 5 1/2" x 8 1/a" 
(and-its double, 6 172" xi"). These are, 
in fact, the page sizes that will divide 
most evenly into the standard cuts of book 
paper and bond paper. They are convenient, 
but they may turn out to be wasteful. 

For example, the rotaprint metal 
sheet, now officially known as Rotaplate, 
measures LLU x ia it willl cake pertect=

tess than 42% of the available printing 
surface would be wasted. In printing a 
booker 123 pages, 6 x 9") on this) ~ma— 
chine, sixty-four plates would be required, 
for no more than two pages could go on each 
plate. At $1.50 a plate, the cost would be 
$96.00, and of this about 427, or $40.00, 
18 wasted. Whoever would print 6" x 9" 
pages should find a printer with another

ly, or with minimum wastage, on the metal 
Sheet of the press that will be used on the 
job. 


(d) Area Costs and Legibility 

The principle which permits this 
economy has wide application. Since the 
printing surface for the photo-offset proc- 
elo, is prepared. photographically, the mwa 
terial to be reproduced can be enlarged or 
reduced to any degree desired. The pur- 
chaser buys the use of a certain number of 











square inches of printing surface; it is 
almost immaterial to the printer what is 
contained within these dimensions. This 
opens the publisher to an interesting temp- 
tation. He can enormously reduce the! cost 
of reproducing any given text by reducing 
the size of the print. If he cuts the 
print in half; he inereases Teurlold aus 
amount of printed matter on his area of 
metal. Thus, it has been proposed that the 
New York Times be issued in a half-size edi- 
tion for permanent preservation. 

The ease with which photo-offset 
printers can enlarge or reduce the size of 
the matter they copy, taken in connection 
with the controlling posi clon om aneamcocinc, 
gives to the problem of legibility a spe- 
cial importance. The size of the type-face 
can be fixed at any point, from microscopic 
to above normal, and while the diameter is 
shrinking in arithmetical series--1,2,65,4, 
--the cost of producing the copies is 
shrinking in geometrical series--2,4,8,16. 
This situation creates a temptation to pull 
the size of the print down to the lowest 
point of legibility. There would seem to 
be several thresholds: first, the limiting 
size of the type that can be read without 
special ‘strain or attention (eccordime sce 
Vernon, it is 6-point type); below tiie 
there is perhaps the smallest type that can 
be read without the use of a reading glass; 
and below that, the lower limit of reading 
glass efficiency.l1 Efforts have been made 
to use photo-offset at all these levels. 
The Hispanic Society has reprinted a rare 
Spanish dictionary in a reduction to one- 
Salvia (one alnntsy Yowenlyeatiayel tl size.t® The experi- 
ment of the New York Times with a miniature 
edition reduced 50% from 7-point type has

reading. For the present, it is necessary

The Joint Committee on Materials 
for Research secured the help of Professors 
Donald G. Paterson and Miles A, Tinker of 
the University of Minnesota in examining 
this problem. By a speed-of-reading test 
these scholars studied the legibility of 
mewsprint of normal size (7-point) and 
newsprint reduced to 80%, 50% and 30% of 
normal size. The result of their work isa

Photo-Offset: Reprint Economy 
An important cost element that must 


also be taken into account in evaluating 
the photo-offset process is that of re- 
print economy. The idea of "reprint econo- 
my" Sis-one of basic importance in alll pub— 
lishing accountancy. It deserves, there- 
fore, a close analysis. It has been show 
that publishing costs are of two kinds: 
PiosicCOsy and running Cost, and that the 
first cost is a composite of two elements, 
eompostblon Cost and area cost. If a book 
can be made to pay its way in an edition of 
2000, a reprint of the book, manufactured 
by the same process, could also be expect- 
ed to pay its way provided 2000 new pur- 
chasers should appear after the exhaustion 
bf the first edition. The number of pro- 
spective readers that can make a first edi- 
tion pay can always make a second edition 
pay. But under certain conditions, the 
number of readers required to make a sec- 
ond edition pay need not be as large as 
that required to make the first edition 
pay. This result will follow whenever some 
of the work that has been paid for, as the

tionary importance of this element in the 








AND REPRINTS ; RO 


cost structure of text reproduction is re- 
alized most completely in microcopying, but 
the element is also present in relief 
printing and in photo-offset work. 

The printer from raised type can 
hold his type or change his form into an 
electrotype by printing it in wax and de- 
positing electrolytic copper in the wax 
matrix. He can then preserve the electro-— 
types and make a second printing without 
incurring any composition costs. But ellec= 
trotypes and stereotypes are almost out of 
the question except for large editions. The 
CLEOEROGyDemnO camo! moon Olpace, ane am DOO 
of 128 straight-type pages, will cost ap- 
proximately $1.50 a page unmounted, $2.00 
a page mounted. The corresponding photo- 
offset device is to preserve the metal 
sheets, protected with a coating of gum and 
Ready BOR Vas seconds Pum. 

Some firms do not save the metal 
sheets, but save rather the photographic 
negatives from which they were prepared. 
The policies of photo"offset companies dif- 
fer in the matter of passing on to the con- 
sumer the reprint economies made possible 
by saving the metal sheet or negative. Some 
policies and economies are here described

The importance of reprint economy 
is twofold. It can lower the cost of cer- 
baimespeciiic printings of books..and eit 
can affect policy in regard to overprints. 
If a second printing is cheaply available, 
it is not necessary to risk large first 
printings that may remain unsold. 


Photo-Offset: the Outlook for the Future 
The development of the photo-offset 


apparatus as an additional shop equipment for 





letterpress printers has already had an im- 
portant influence on scholarship through 
the production of cheap reprints. ina G 
least one instance--the making of the new 
Early Modern English and Middle English Dic- 
tionaries under the sponsorship of the Amer- 
ican Council of Learned Societies--it has 
resulted in an extraordinary saving of 
scholarly labor. The editors of these new 
dictionaries have selected the writings of 
this period to be used in the dictionaries. 
The manuscripts and early prints have been 
reproduced by photo-offset and set before 
the scholars in loose-leaf form--about 200 
impressions of each page. The scholar 
takes one page and marks in it all the 
words to be indexed. A typist then takes 
one loose-leaf for each word marked by the 
scholar, types the marked work at the top 
of the leaf and files it alphabetically. 
This method would seem to reduce the making 
of concordances to an almost wholly mechan- 
ical procedure. 

What kinds of technological de- 
velopments of photolithography would be 
likely to have an important impact on 
scholarship? Nothing that affects the 
cost levels of the very long runs will have 
any significance.15 But if the time should 
come when the apparatus would be so far 
simplified and the process so far cheapened 
that it could become a kind of multiple 
photostat,a part of the equipment of any 
large library and serviced by ordinary li- 
brary idabor, turning out extra copies of 
library rarities for sale or exchange with 
other libraries and sometimes multiplying 
overused library materials for teaching 
purposes, great results in the intellectual 


13. Technological developments having their principal bearing on long-run work are the Uhertype apparatus, 
consisting of a photo-composing machine, by which letters are photographed on a film strip, and a 


make-up machine, which is a large reproducing camera; The Telet 


esetter, which operates slug-casting 


machines automatically with perforated tape; the Typary, producing proof slips, photoprinted on paper, 
which may be used to make negatives from which positives are produced on offset metal plates; some— 
times translucent paper is used in the machine to make proofs which can be used directly on the metal 
plates; the Typon, employed for photo-production with the Typary by camera or contact, in which a pa— 
per strip film is used instead of a dry or wet plate; Walton's typesetting machine, which writes di- 


rectly on a metal sheet for offset printing; various other devices activated by the photoelectric 


cell. 


In offset printing, important experiments are being made in mercury processes, in which mer- 


cury is used instead of water as an ink-repelling medium; in developing formulae for producing deep- 


etched plates; in 


offset, when the plate is treated with an ink repellent, which does away with 


the moistening rollers of the offset press and controls both the temperature of the plate and the hu- 
midity of the air around the plate, thus providing and keeping constant the moisture needed through- 


out the run.

world would be likely to follow. How far 
is technology from that possibility? Cer- 
tain. new developments tending in this di- 
rection have come to the knowledge of the 
writer, but must for the time being be 
kept confidential. 

The rotaprint was the first ma-— 
chine to offer itself as a piece of office 
equipment. The cost of a rotaprint instal- 
lation is about $1000 (9" x 14" model, 
friction feed; suction feed, about $1575). 
ine latvest rotaprint model, R 50, ts 
$660.00 complete. Compare this with the 
price of photostat equipment, which is 
$800. Then came the multilith, offering 
an installation for $630.00 (friction feed, 
ia its standard size, 9 1/2" x 12 1/2" 
printing surface, 10" x 14" paper). There 
has been developed a combination mimeo- 
graph and offset press which will permit a 
changing over from the mimeograph stencil, 
inked from the inside, to a photo-offset 
metal plate, inked from the outside. There 
is some possibility that a system may be 
devised whereby a kind of photostat paper 
can be treated to become a printing sur- 
face, The operator would make a photostat 
copy of a page, treat the photostat nega- 
tive, fasten it on a small press, and run 
off a number of copies. New developments 
are appearing every year. The major insti- 
tutional changes in scholarship can be ex- 
pected to begin with the development of a 
photo-offset process so simple that the 
printing surface is prepared at the area 
cost level of the photostat copy and the 
running costs of making copies stand at the 
cost level of the mimeograph,. 


Reprint Processes: Dermaprint 
The dermaprint is at present the 


process that tends toward this desideratum. 
It is a photographic process tied to the 
mimeograph. It is not planographic nor 
does it use the offset principle, but it 
does the same kind of work that the cheaper 
offset presses do. The relative fineness 
of the products of these processes can be 
compared if the sample dermaprint page 
bound herewith (Figure XIV) is compared 
with the sample products of the multilith 
and rotaprint (Figures XXV and XXVI). 

The page to be dermaprinted was 
selected because it was yellowed with age 
and contained a line cut. The standard 
charge of the A. B. Dick Company for an 





AND REPRINTS on 





8 1/2" x 11" dermaprint stencil is $3.50, 
which includes a small amount of retouch- 
ing. If a considerable amount of retouch- 
ing is necessary, there is a standard ex- 
tra charge of $1.00 per hour. The cost of 
the materials needed to make this particu- 
lar stencil was $.64, which included a 
film negative and a film positive. Had a 
paper negative and a paper positive been 
used, the materials cost would have been 
somewhat lower. One hour and forty-five 
minutes were needed for the preparation of 
the stencil. 

While the A. B. Dick Company gave 
their very generous cooperation in the 
preparation of the dermaprint stencil re- 
produced here, they call attention to the 
fact that, in general, the dermaprint proc-— 
ess at the present time is more to be used 
with direct contact prints than with the 
use of the camera. The reader may judge 
for himself, by comparing the dermaprint 
product shown here with the cost calcula- 
tions given above, what place dermaprinting 
can have in the reproduction of research 
materials. 

The dermaprint stencil resembles 
the ordinary mimeograph stencil in appear- 
ance. It is a fibrous sheet impregnated 
with a substance impervious to ink. But 
whereas the ordinary mimeograph stencil is 
impregnated with a material resembling wax, 
which can be mechanically abraded by the 
typewriter stroke until the ink will pene- 
trate through the bruised parts, the derma- 
print stencil is impregnated with some kind 
of gelatinlike substance which is subject 
to tanning or toughening in the presence 
of the chromate ion. Whereas ordinary gela- 
tin will dissolve in water, a gelatin that 
has been tanned will resist water. This 
is the chemical principle upon which the 
dermaprint works. 

The raw sheet, already covered with 
a gelatin, is sensitized with ammonium bi- 
chromate or, more commonly, potassium bi- 
chromate. Ultra-violet light on the potas- 
sium bichromate will release the chromate 
ions and tan the gelatin. It is only nec- 
essary, then, to subject to ultra-violet 
light those parts of the sheet that are to 
be kept ink-resistant. The dermaprint 
stencil must, therefore, be prepared by 
using a biack-on-white or positive photo- 
graph, or, as in the production of the so- 
ealled "special stencil," from ansoriginail

black-on-white drawing on very thin or 
transparent paper, tracing cloth, vellun, 
or celluloid. “In this it -differssfrom the 
ordinary photo-offset metal sheet, whichis 
prepared as a printing surface by using a 
negative photograph. The light that reach- 
es the surface of the offset metal sheet 
hardens upon the metal the substance that 
will accept ink; the light that reaches the 
surface of the dermaprint stencil hardens 
the substance that will resist ink and keep 
it from passing through. The positive 
photograph or the original drawing is 
pressed against the dermaprint sheet ina 
vacuum frame and exposed to an intense 
light. Then it is given a bath in warm 
water and dried. The warm water dissolves 
out that part of the gelatin which has 
been protected by black ink from the rays 
of the light, but leaves the other part in- 
tact. Thus a stencil has been prepared 
automatically. 


The cost of equipment for the derm- 
aprint comes into the same price range with 
the cost of multilith apparatus unless the 
photostat and the mimeograph have already 
been purchased.14

14. The photographic equipment needed for transferring matter to the stencil may cost from $20.00 to 


$1300, with many possible combinations in between. 


The $20.00 equipment, which may be used for the 


direct process only, does not include a vacuum frame; the same equipment, with a $60.00 Eastman pres-— 


sure frame, costs $75.00, and with a vacuum frame, $150.00. 


This same equipment may be used to pre- 


pare the photographic stencils if the user purchases his film positives from a maker of offset plates. 
If a photostat and a special adapting holder are used, the equipment will cost about $260.00, figur- 

ing $85.00 for a holder, $155.00 for a vacuum frame, and about $20.00 for dark-room equipment; if the 
photostat prepares a film positive, the $23.00 equipment may be used, the total cost of the equipment 


being about $110.00. 


Mimeographs vary in price from $30.00 to $450.00.

because the dermaprint must have a positive 
copy, while photo-offset can use the nega- 
tive. The photographer is through when he 
has made his negative for photo-offset, but 
if he is preparing for the dermaprint, he 
is only half through and must still make a 
positive from his negative.15 The cost of 
making this positive copy can be kept down 
if it is made by the filmslide process (see 
Chapter VI). Ordinarily the dermaprint 
uses just twice as much photographic paper 
as photo-offset. Moreover, it is not quite 
certain that the dermaprint can be pre- 
pared with a paper negative; if it turns 
out that film negatives are required, the 
cost of photographic materials mounts even 
further abave the level of the photograph- 
ic requirements of photo-offset.

Whether the dermaprint allows genu- 
ine operating economies is still an open 
question. The A. B. Dick Company offers to 
prepare these stencils, but the prices are 
so high that the service has no place in 
competition with other methods of book pro- 
duction. 

Customer installations make these 
prices less important. Tite Sav Bs) Datel: 
Company has decided definitely to sell the 
unsensitized stencils at $7.00 a package

seem to be a practical reproduction method 
for any institution possessing photographic 
equipment and a mimeograph.16

CHAPTER IV 


THE TYPESCRIPT BOOK OR MEMORANDUM: 
TYPESCRIPT 


The typewriter has been well estab-— 
lished as the device by which all scholarly 
work is prepared for publication. Authors 
often use it when drafting their manu- 
scripts. Typed copy is always submitted to 
the publisher by the author and to the lin- 
otyper by the publishers. The fact that 
the typewriting stage intervenes so many 
times in the preparation of reading matter 
for distribution raises a question as to 
whether typescript could be carried not 
only as far as the linotyper, but also as 
far as the reader. In.other words, whatis 
the case for the typescript book? 

In terms of the number of words 
written or the number of words printed and 
read, typescript rivals newsprint as the 
standard conventional writing form of con- 
temporary civilization. Everyone is famil- 
jar with the typescript letter. Business 
men use information sheets and confidential 
letter services that are really periodicals 
in mimeographed form; they are becoming in- 
creasingly accustomed to seeing catalogues 
and statistical studies produced in type- 
script by "near-print" methods. The Gov- 
ernment frequently mimeographs its reports. 
But the use of typescript is not generally 
associated with the publication of the in- 
ternal documentation of scholarship. This 
is true, not on account of any deficiency 
from the standpoint of legibility, but be- 
eause the possibilities of reproducing 
typescript economically and attractively 
have not been fully explored by the schol- 
arly world. 

This is really surprising in view 
of the fact that nearly everyone knows ina 
general way the qualities of the typewrit- 
er and the extent to which it has affected 
office practice. The typewriter itself is 
so cheap and widely distributed, and the 
skill to use it is so easily acquired, that 
its operating costs are low. Bond paper, 
filing cabinets, folders, and loose-leaf 
notebooks have been standardized to sizes 





THE TYPEWRITER AND 


that conform to it. Office appliances, even 
the office offset press, are keyed to its 

8 1/2" x 11" sheet. There is only one 
standard measurement that has never con- 
formed to it--that is library shelving. Li- 
brary shelving is spaced to care for pages 
10" or less in height. Libraries receiv- 
ing typescript books on full-size typewrit- 
er paper are put to the inconvenience of 
shelving them with oversize books. But 
elsewhere the typewriter has brought equip- 
ment and practice into line with its dimen- 
sions. 

By what means may the typescript 
book be produced? It may be a first copy 
from under the typewriter ribbon, as so 
many of our theses are, or it may be a copy 
multiplied by hectograph, mimeograph, or 
photo-offset. The choice of any of these 
reproduction methods for the multiplying of 
typescript material depends upon the de- 
gree of legibility afforded by the tech- 
nique selected and upon the costs involved, 


which may be analyzed, as in the case of 


él 


the printed books, as first costs (composi- 
tion and area costs) and running costs. Of 
the methods mentioned, photo-offset pre- 
sents the most complex problems in cost 
levels and legibility on account of the 
possibility of photographically reducing 
the size of the typescript in making a 
photo-offset copy. 

The four mechanical devices for 
multiplying typescript will be separately 
analyzed in the following chapter, but it 
is necessary in the first instance to 
understand the characteristics of the type- 
writer itself. 


The Standard Typewriter 

The standard typewriters are priced 
at about $110.00. The type is standardized 
in two sizes, known as pica and elite. The 
pica typewriter lays down ten letters to 
the inch, the elite, twelve. How do these 
typescript letters compare with the letters

RESEARCH MATERIALS 





of relief printing? A peculiarity of type- 
script as compared with print-face is the 
equal width of the letters. The typescript 
"it is just as broad as the "ml", This 
equal width is a necessary consequence of 
the mechanical system by which the type- 
writer spaces letters. A number of design- 
ers have proposed or attempted a typescript 
face that will resemble print-face; the 
task of making such a typescript face is 
rendered difficult simply because of the 
equal spacing of the typewriter mechanism. 
A change of the spacing system that would 
give the "i" a narrow space and the "m" a 
broad one would greatly complicate the ma- 
chine and make it more expensive. 


A new spacing mechanism has 
recently appeared inGermany. One model 
is available in America, in the hands of 
Edwards Brothers. This paragraph has 
been typed with it. Note that there are three 
different letter widths - the narrow letters 
such as f and i, the middle-sized letters 
such as d and g, and the two broad letters, 
w and m. The typewriter letter levers are 
linked each with one of two spacing rods; 
the m and w are given additional width by 
the typist, who strikes the space bar when- 
ever she uses these two letters. 

The difference in spacing is eas- 
ily seen when setin a column in groups of 
Six.

This new spacing device opens 
a new field fo the designers of typescript 
face. 


Special types are available, such 
as micro-elite, laying down fourteen let- 
ters to the inch, or ultra micro-elite, lay- 
ing down sixteen letters to the inch. Their 
interlinear spacing is usually six lines to 
the inch. A sample page done with micro- 


elite type is shown in Figure XXVIII. 


The Equivalence of Type and Typescript 


If the horizontal measurement of 
typescript were taken as the basis in as- 
signing it a position in the point system 
of typography, the following table of 
equivalents would result: 


Pica typescript would be equivalent to 14-pt. type. 


Elite typescript would be equivalent to 12-pt. type. 
Pica reduced to 80% of normal size to 10-pt. type. 
Pica reduced to 70% of normal size to 9-pt. type. 
Pica reduced to 60% of normal size to 8-pt. type. 
Pica reduced to 50% of normal size to T7-pt. type. 
Pica reduced to 40% of normal size to 6-pt. type. 
Pica reduced to 30% of normal size to 5-pt. type. 


If, on the other 
cal measurement of typescript were 
it would be obvious that. 


hand, the verti- 
taken, 


Pica typescript would be equivalent to 10-pt. type. 
Elite typescript would be equivalent to 8-pt. type. 
Pica reduced to 80% of normal size to 7-pt. type. 
Pica reduced to 70% of normal size to 6-pt. type. 


The relative importance of the hor- 
izontal and vertical measurements of type 
controlling legibility has not been de- 
termined; it is, therefore, difficult to 
work out an accurate table of equivalents 
between print-face and typescript sizes and 
reductions. Since groups of letters or 
words, instead of single letters, consti- 
tute a sensory unit, it is probable that 
the vertical measurement of type is a more 
important factor in its effect on the read- 
ing rate, and consequently upon legibility, 
than the horizontal measurement. If such 
is the case, it would follow that type- 
script, despite its horizontal spread, is 
but slightly more legible than print-face 
of the same vertical point size. Fig- 
ure XV-shows blocks of 1l-, 9-, 7-, and 6- 
point print-face type and corresponding 
blocks of typescript reduced to approxi- 
mately the same legibility. The reader may 
note how far legibility affects word con- 
tent by comparing the samples. To judge 
how far legibility suffers when typescript 
is so reduced as to lay down the same word 
content as print-face type on an identical 
area, the reader is asked to examine Fig- 
ure XXIX.

of varying reductions, having approximately the same legibility.

Simple Paper Permits Alignment of Typewriting 


Scholars have been slow to accept photoli- 
thograpny as a solution of the problem of 
scholarly publishing because of the unconven- 
tional format whicn is produced by typescript 
Because of the equal spacing produced by the 
conventional typewriter, a compromise had to 
be made in the design of the letters so that 
wide and narrow letters would occupy the same 
space. The result was that a letter such as 
'm' had to be condensed, and a narrow letter 
such as 'i't had to be extended. 


The fallacy of attempting to put regular 
printing types on the ordinary equal space 
typewriter is illustrated in the following 
paragraphs. The copy in the first paragraph 
was set up by a printer in the usual manner, 
without any attempt at justification. It was 
then reset, as it would appear if the type 
used were attached to the conventional type- 
writer. The lower case 'w' was used as the 
standard of horizontal spacing. 


Authorities agree that William Caslon was in- 

fluenced greatly in the design of his famous face 

by Dutch types which were used widely in Eng- 

land when he started his work. As D. B. Updike 

points out, while Caslon “modelled his letters on

The typewriter, moreover, does not produce 
justified lines, leaving an uneven right-hand 
margin so unusual in book printing that con- 
ventional taste will prevent the ready accept 
ance of typescript books. Fortunately it is 
now possible by the use of Vogeltype Aligning 
Paper to overcome one of the greatest objec- 
tions to the use of typescript in scholarly 
work. The invention also permits the produc- 
tion of many sizes and styles of type without 
any change in the typewriter keyboard, as 
illustrated in the headlines on this page. 


By producing a justified right-hand margin, 
typescript approaches printface in appearance. 
Doubtless through the development of a type- 
writer having automatic variable spacing, 


such as was built into the first typewriters 
invented, and type similar to ordinary print- 
face, it will be possible for a scholar at 
his desk to produce a page format which can 
not be distinguished from real typeset matter. 
Thus modern technology, curiously, will bring 
man back to the conditions of the Middle Ages, 
when the scholar often was his own scribe. 





A new stretchable paper permits typewritten 
copy to be aligned evenly on right-hand edges, 
allows lithographic production of books, briefs, 


etc., closely resembling printing, but cheaper 


Scholars, moreover,. Will be able to illus- 
trate their texts with photographs, graphs 
and tabular matter simply by making a pasteup 
combining illustrations and text. The photo- 
lithographic process allows great flexibility 
in preparing copy. Thus the above photogram 
of Vogeltype Aligning Paper was reproduced mm 
a plave for the offset press by simply past= 
ing a clipping from a magazine into its posi- 
tion in the text. 


The greatly reduced reproductions on the 
reverse side of this page illustrate some of 
the many applications of Vogeltype Aligning 
Paper. Books, bulletins, house organs, pro- 
ceedings of meetings, circulars, theses and 
lectures are now produced without the expense 
of type composition and engravings.

FIGURE XVII 
@ MASTER GOPY FOR PHOTO OFFSET PRINTING e@ 


Business men throughout the country, particularly 
those known as printers, are well aware of the fact 
that a new printing process is here, and that very 
large savings are possible from its use. This new 
method is known as Offset Lithography. It isasim- 
ple process, fast and inexpensive. Illustrations 
can be used at no extra cost for plates. Business 
offices are finding it desirable to install offset 
presses, and many hundreds of these machines are turn— 
ing out work that.is satisfactory in every way. Speed 
and economy are the factors that create interest. 
Where the cost of the offset press is too much for 
Phessnallerspusianess oLiices 1 as the practicestor 
such offices to make their own master copy and send 
same to a commercial offset house to be printed. 


The great problem in Photo Offset work is met in the 
making of the master copy. The copy may be printed 
from type set up by a printer, composed on a lino- 
type, written by a typewriter, or by the Vari-typer 
Composing Machine, built especially for this work. 
Type-set or linotype copy is too expensive, for af- 
Lemenicematten 1S esetelp,e tMempreateste part Onestne 
printing cost has then been incurred. Typewriting 
is very unsatisfactory, because only one style of 
type can be used on any one machine. Typewritten 
matter is cold and anemic to the artistic eye, and 
creates the very effect most business men are trying 
to escape. The only real composing machine which 
will write copy at a low cost, and at the same time 
absolutely delight the person interested, is the 
Vari-typer, manufactured in New York City by the 
Ralph C. Coxhead Corporation. It must be stated here, 
however, that as with most machines, the degree of 
satisfaction will vary withthe intelligence and ar- 
tistry of the operator. 


The Vari-typer is constructed to use different type 
plates, of whichmore than sixty in English are avail-— 
able, and more than two-hundred in foreign languages. 
Type may be changed instantly. Variable character 
spacing isa feature of each machine, whichmeans that 
letters may be written at as many characters to the 
inch as the different sizes of type make necessary, 
limited, of course, to 3 different spacings on any 
one machine. These three may be any combination of 
the spacings 10, 12, 14 or 16 letters to the inch. 
This machine also permits the use of six different 
vertical or line spacings. The keyboard is easy to 
operate especially if the operator has had typewriter 
experience as the touch system is used for both and 
the keyboards are almost exactly alike. 


Provision is made for LARGE BOLD HEADINGS and this 
effect is very cleverly produced. Justification of 
the right hand margin requires first writing of the 
copy so as to determine what adjustment is necessary 
and to so indicate at the end of each line. This 
adjustment is provided for by absorption or exten- 
sion in the second writing by use of adevice called 
the half-—back spacer. This method prevents the riv- 
ers of white space so common to justification when 
attempted by typewriters and which is so objection-— 
able to good printers. 


Vari-typer is manufactured in many models to meet 
different requirements. The special machine which 
the Coxhead Corporation builds for the Photo Offset 
Field, is equipped with special mechanism to handle 
carbon paper ribbon in addition to cotton and silk 
ribbons. Thecarbon paper ribbons produce remarkably 
clean cut work and a specially constructed ribbon, 
300 feet in length, is used which is different than 
any other ribbon on the market. This ribbon does 
not travel when the space bar is used, thus produc-— 
ing a considerable economy. 


Recently this Company produced a new type plate with 
all metal construction which is a great improvement 
over anything so far offered Lo wthe trademey iis 
called Krometal and produces copy that should please 
those who like artistic results. Most of the plates 
used on the Vari-typer Composing Machines are being 
built under the new frometal process. 


Writers of manuscript find many features that Vari- 
typer provides, of unusual value. The advantages 
that follow the ability to use italics in marking 
passages for emphasis isanexample. As the machine 
is always loaded with two type plates, the operator 
may change instantly from one to the otherbya sim- 
ple movement of the wrist. The variation of type is 
of tremendous interest to all writers. 


Statisticians, librarians, accountants are very en- 
thusiastic over the condensation possibilities of 
the Vari-typer through the use of proper typography. 
Large statements may be reduced as muchas50% with- 
out detracting fromthe readability. One large con- 
cern in Cleveland, Ohio, weare told, uses nine Vari- 
typers on the writing of statements in condensed 
form. The results are very pleasing to executives. 


Footnotes are outstanding intheir effect when writ- 
ten with the type appropriate for this purpose. 


The Coxhead Company is continually working on new 
styles of type and are always interested in discus-— 
Sing this subject withthe business and professional 
man. 


Considering the work that this composing machine 
does, the cost isvery reasonable. It is well known 
that composition forms the greater part of printing 
prices and it does seem that the Vari-typer can soon 
save its cost to any business man interested in the 
subject. The fact that this machine is sold in al- 
most every country of the world, is indication that 
it solves one problem of the office executive, that 
of doing necessary work at a saving in cost and with 
thesdesined wet teciter 


Much thought should be given to the matter of com- 
position for photo offset presses, as the saving to 
be made from the use of this process will soon dis-— 
appear, if either the results are unsatisfactory, or 
the method used for composition proves too costly. 
It should not be forgotten that some reduction of 
copy through the camera will enhance the result. 


THE TYPESCRIPT BOOK OR MEMORANDUM 55 


The Uneven Right-Hand Margin 
Closely related to the fact that 


typescript letters are of equal width is 
the inability of the machine to make an 
even right-hand margin. The linotype or 
monotype readjusts the spacing of the let- 
ters in a line in such a way as to make all 
of the lines on a page equal in length or, 
as it is said, to "justify" them. The type- 
writer cannot do this, except by one or two 
expensive means, which require either a 
special typewriter and an extra typing, or 
a special kind of paper. 

By using the Varityper, and by re- 
sorting to two typings, an even right-hand 
margin can be made. On the first copy the 
typist makes the right-hand margin come as 
near the line as possible, usually missing 
it by not more than two or three letters 
long or short. Then the copy is blue- 
penciled to indicate places where the 
space can be extended or contracted. Ina 
second typing, each line will be written 
exactly as it isin the first copy, except 
that the extra letters will be absorbed in 
the line by crowding the spacing between 
the words or letters, or a short line will 
be stretched out by increasing the spaces 
between the words or letters. Opinions 
differ as to whether the resulting copy 
looks choppy or uneven. A sample of Vari- 
type work is shown in Figure XVII. As has 
been said, this process requires the use of 
the Varityper machine, which has a variable 
horizontal spacing, and of course the ex- 
tra typing process adds to the composition 
cost for labor and proofreading. This meth- 
od of justifying the right-hand margin 
could be used for hectographing and mimeo- 
graphing as well as for photo-offset work. 

There is another method which can 
be used for justifying the right-hand mar- 
gin. The Vogeltype Aligning Paper Corpora- 
tion, Federal Trust Building, Newark, New 
Jersey, has devised a special kind of 
stretchable paper cemented to a backing 
sheet. The copy is typed on this paper in 
the conventional manner without regard to 
alignment. After the sheet is taken from 
the typewriter, short lines are stretched 
to the correct length, as illustrated in 
Figure XVI. At present the paper is 
priced at $.24 a sheet in quantities of 
twenty-five sheets, with reductions in price 
for larger quantities. The sheets are made 
to contain from forty-eight to eighty lines 








of type each, and each line has a maximum 
length of 9", Separate sheets are made for 
vertical line spacing of three, four, four 
and one-half, five, and six lines to the 
inch. For great primer type (eighteen 
point), four lines to the inch give the 
most readable results; pica and elite type 
give the best results with five and six- 
space paper respectively. From a typo- 
graphic standpoint, copy set with these 
spaces between the lines is more readable 
than when lines are set closer to each 
other. The typing area of the sheets

A third device for justifying type- 
script is a mechanism in the process of de- 
velopment by Professor Charles C. Peters of 
the Pennsylvania State College. An attach- 
ment to an ordinary typewriter automatical- 
ly controls, the length of thesline. This 
attachment consists essentially of a screw 
which progressively displaces the carriage 
in relation to the writing point. The just- 
ifying requires a preliminary or fair copy 
typing to indicate the number of spaces by 
which the line must be lengthened or short- 
ened. In the format typing, the proper one 
of seven controls is engaged at the begin- 
ning of each line, and the excess of defi- 
ciency in length is apportioned equally 
among the fifty-four or so spaces. The ap- 
paratus at present writing permits lengthen- 
ing or shortening by a maximum of three 
spaces. Pending the patenting of the de- 
vice and its assignment to a commercial 
company, Dr. Peters will furnish a simple 
form of this device for use with any make 
of typewriter for $12.00, or a more auto- 
matic form for $25.00. Changes necessary 
in the typewriter itself restrict the line 
which may subsequently be written with it 
to about seven inches in the case of the 
10"-typewriter. An alternative is to pur- 
chase through Dr. Peters a typewriter with 
the adjustment already made, for $60.00 or 
$75.00, depending upon the type of attach- 
ment furnished. The reader is referred to 
Statistical Procedures and Their Mathemati- 
cal Bases, by Dr. Peters and Walter P. Van- 
Voohis (1935) as an example of a_ photo- 
offset book for which the master copy was 
prepared by Dr. Peters! device. 


The Varityper and the Electromatic Type- 
writer 





There are two special typewriters 


54 





which are at once more expensive and more 
useful for certain typing processes. The 
Varityper, mentioned above, was developed 
from the Hammond machine; it permits the 
typist to choose among a number of type 
faces, type sizes, and corresponding verti- 
cal and horizontal spacings. These alter- 
natives are here tabulated and some of the 
faces available are shown in Figure XVIII.

HKighteen characters to the inch may 
be had on the "7", "L", and "W" in place of 
the sixteen characters to the inch, and on 
the "Q" in place of the fourteen, at an ad- 
ditional charge of $25.00 per machine. The 
fourteen-to-the-inch spacing and the six- 
teen-to-the-inch spacing are the same as 
those called "micro-elite" and "ultra- 
micro-elite" on the standard typewriters. 

All type plates are priced at $5.00. 
each. The Varityper is sold for $210.00 to 
$360.00 for the power-run models, ranging 
from a 9"- to a 24"-carriage, and for 
$140.00 to $160.00 for the non-motor mod- 
els, which can be obtained with a 9"-car- 
riage only. 

The Electromatic typewriter has the 
standard typescript faces and spacings, but 
makes the impression with electric power 
rather than finger power. It is especial-- 
ly useful in increasing the number of legi- 
ble carbon copies, where pressure in the 
typewriter strokes is all-important. The 
Standard Electromatic typewriter is sold 
for $225.00 for the 12"-carriage and 
$250.00 for the 16"-carriage.

The accurate study of the typewrit- 
ing costs to be assessed against the multi- 
plication of the book requires that they 
be separated from those incidental to the 
writing of the book. For purposes of clar- 
ity, therefore, three stages in the type- 
script preparation of a book may be dis- 
tinguished from each other. 

The first stage is the making of 
the draft copy. This is the author's prod- 
uct. It may be in longhand or in type- 
script, oF in a ycombinationsontpoth samo uere 
the pile of pages, often much interlined 
and scratched, which the writer turns over 
to a typist, if he can afford one. 

The second stage in the prepara- 
tion of the book is here called the making 
of the fair copy. The fair copy is#ine 
manuscript as it has been prepared for sub- 
mission to an editor if the book is to be 
printed; it is the pile of typescript that 
comes back from the typist. Sometimes the 
author prepares his own fair copy; some- 
times the so-called fair copy is not very 
fair. But as a normal stage in the normal

This is a sample mimeographed page to illustrate some of the type faces, type sizes, and

paragraph is written with Miniature Roman type, in nine point size, with six lines to the 
inch. This type lays down fourteen letters to the inch and is similar to the micro-elite 
type of the standard typewriter. When typing a text in which there are characters not in 
the Roman alphabet, the non—Roman characters may be available in a Varityper type plate, 


which costs $500 ($8.50 in metal).

THE TYPESCRIPT 


BOOK OR MEMORANDUM 55 





movement of a book, this fair copy typing 
can be set apart from the making of the 
draft copy. It is a more mechanical pro- 
cedure; a typist can make the fair copy, 
only the author can make the draft copy. 

If the book is to be multiplied in 
typescript, a third stage will intervene, 
and a third typing may be necessary. The 
text must be transferred to the printing 
surface medium required by the chosen re- 
production process. Also the usual one- 
column, double-spaced format used for the 
fair-copying operation nay not be the 
most desirable format for the finished 
typescript book; the margins of the fair 
copy may be too narrow for maximum legibil- 
ity in hectographing; the one-column for- 
mat of the fair copy may be less desirable 
than a two-column one if mimeographing is 

decided upon; the typed letters of the 
fair copy may not be dark enough or clean- 
cut enough to photograph well for photo- 
offset reproduction. The final typing re— 
quired to put the text in the desired 
format on the hectograph master sheet, the 
mimeograph stencil, or the master copy pa- 
per for photo-offset is called the format 
typing. 

To summarize: the draft copy is a 
step in the writing of a books; the cost of 
making it is not a composition cost in the 
case of either the printed book or the 
typescript book. The cost of the format 
typing, which is always a stage in the mul- 
tiplication of the typescript book, is al- 
ways a true composition cost. The fair 
Copy may be copy for the linotyper or 
photo-offset typist, in which case its 
Cosu is not a true ‘composition cost, as its 
making is a stage in the writing process.

The Fair Copy as a Stage in the Writing 
RRoOcess 
ihewauthoreon a book is wsually ex— 





pected to bring his work through the fair 
copy stage at his own expense. The cost 

of preparing the fair copy depends in part 
upon the condition of the draft copy. There 
may be a variation of 20% to 33 1/3% in the 
typing charges due to the condition of the 
draft. The cost depends also upon the num- 
ber of unusual symbols and figures that oc- 
cur, as it takes longer to type technical 
and tabular material than straight non- 
technical text. But fundamentally the cost 
Of preparing eas falLre copy iromea drains 
determined by the length of the manuscript. 

The unit of measurement for type- 
writer work ought to be the keystroke, but 
it is usually the page of 250 to 300 words, 
double-spaced. The keystroke corresponds 
roughly to the em of linotype composition. 
Whereas the number of ems per word is usu- 
ally only four or five, the number of key- 
strokes varies from six to seven. 

It is estimated that in copying 
typescript, a standard speed ought to be

equivalent to 915 to 1950 words.t This 
should cover from three to seven pages. By 
gathering estimates of standard speeds and 
figures for wage levels, consulting adver- 
tisements in writers! manuals, and collect- 
ing specific commercial estimates from typ- 
ing bureaus, a rough estimate has been 
made of the cost of typescript copying, per 
thousand words:

A consideration of these costs 
gives rise to the question of whether or 
not it would be profitable to turn over a

publisher without having a fair copy made. 
It must be taken for granted that printing 
requires a carefully prepared fair copy. 
If an imperfect Copy is set before the lin- 
otyper, the author's correction charges 
mount rapidly. As a matter of fact, the 
author often sends to the editor a sup-

numerable crudities and easily corrected 
errors. Une editors of pubilichinge Vaoucses 
have learned to expect this. They main- 
tain in their offices readers who can go

make it ready for the linotyper. This 
service is necessarily assessed into the

FIGURE XIX 


The effect of a variation in apparatus and typists! skill 
in the preparation of the format copy for photo-offset work 


is illustrated in this sample page. 


The page has been printed 


on the same press as the other pages of the book; it would not 
be different from other pages except for the differences in 

the original typings. These differences are exhibited by di- 
viding the page into sections, each section showing the effect 
of the varying conditions under which the format copy was typed.

copy makes it customarily while preparing 
the fair copy. She does not plan to make 
a fair copy and then retype the whole text 
in order to make a couple of carbons. lets 
she is making a hectographed edition, there 
will be more of an excuse for extra typing 
simply because the typing is a smaller pro- 
portion of the cost of the whole job. The 
argument is even stronger for a permissi- 
ble separate format typing in the case of 
mimeograph, and strongest of all in the 
case of the rotaprint, multilith, or photo- 
offset processes. The shift is not techno- 
logical, but due to a change in cost per- 
spective. In relation to the expense for 
materials and paper involved in a long run 
Sapcune Trotaprint or multilith, the extra 
composition cost of an additional format 
typing seems small, while in relation to 
the corresponding expenses of a run of 
fifty hectographed copies, the additional 
typing charges seem large. Therefore, it 
can be expected that the fair copy will be 
used as format copy more often in hecto- 
graphing than in mimeographing, and in 
mimeographing more than in offset work. 


The Preparation of the Format Copy from 


the Fair Copy 
Rates for preparing the format copy 


from the fair copy are determined by the 
character of the text and by-the format and 
reproduction method chosen. As has been 
said, it takes longer to type technical ma- 
terial than non-technical, and it costs 
more to type in a two-column format than in 
a@ one-column one. Quotations from Cleve- 
land typing bureaus show that a format copy 
in two columns may be prepared from fair 
copy at an additional charge of about 30%. 
But the reproduction method chosen is the 
chief factor in determining the cost of ad- 
Gditional typing: it is just as easy to 
type on a hectograph master sheet as on or- 
dinary typewriter paper and only a little 
more difficult to cut a mimeograph stencil. 
But it is more of an art to prepare master 
copy for photo-offset reproduction. Extra 
care is required on the part of the typist 
in order to produce copy that will retain 
its legibility when its size has been de- 
creased. The best results are obtained 
when certain kinds of master paper and 
typewriter ribbons are used and when spe- 
cial typewriters like the Varityper or the 
Royal photo-offset typewriter are used; 








THE TYPESCRIPT BOOK OR MEMORANDUM Z 37 





these devices and supplies are not avail- 
able to the author or even to the average 
typing bureau, and it is for this reason 
that photo-offset companies usually prefer 
to have the master copy for photo-offset 
material prepared in their own establish- 
ments. The effect of a variation in appara- 
tus and typist's skill in the preparation 
of the format copy for photo-offset is il- 
lustrated in Figure XIX. The page has been 
printed on the same press with the other 
pages of the book; it would not be differ- 
ent from other pages except for the differ- 
ences in the original typing, as indicated 
on the sample page. 

Quotations made by photo-offset es- 
tablishments for preparing typed master 
copy for photo-offset work range from $.56 
to $1.70 per 1000 words. The usual quota- 
tion is about $1.25. The $1.70 figure was 
given for the preparation of a special two- 
column format with justified lines. One 
company quoted $1.00 per 1000 words for 
technical material in units of several hun- 
dred pages. 

As work of this type is definitely 
chargeable as composition, it is interest- 
ing to compare these rates with those of 
linotype composition: the wage cost for 
linotype composition at $1.15 per hour 
ranges from $.92 to $1.55 per 1000 words 
according to the number of ems set per hour; 
the shop price of linotype composition at 
$3.50 per machine hour ranges from $2.80 
to $4.67 per 1000 words. 

These possibilities of merging or 
shifting typescript composition costs have 
given rise to some inaccurate thinking on 
the subject of the typescript book. Some- 
times a saving in composition cost seems to 
appear like a rabbit out of a magician's 
hat. The topic is sufficiently important 
to warrant further clarifying, which may be 
set up as a formula: 


Tie Asis thie cost On making wairicopy) Lem 
draft copy, ; 
B is the cost of making format copy from 
fair copy and 
C is the cost of making format copy di- 
rectly from draft copy, 


will it always follow that A plus B is 
greater than C? Will there always be a 
saving in working directly from the draft 
copy? Obviously, the answer depe:ds upon 


58 METHODS OF REPRODUCING RESEARCH MATERIALS 





the actual condition of the draft copy and 
the rigidity of the requirements of the 
fommav Copy. Lf the draftmcopyets imeaveny, 
good shape, and the material is to be hec- 
tographed or mimeographed in a standard 
typescript format, the two processes may 
well be merged and the extra typing saved. 
But if the draft copy is very rough and the 
format is a complicated one--such as a 
large two-column arrangement with foot- 
notes--to be subjected to photographic re- 
duction and multiplied by photo-offset, the 
intermediate step of making the fair copy 
is necessary. 

In general it should be noted that 
if the author completes a format copy for 
any of the typescript book publication 
processes, he absorbs the entire composi- 
tion cost of the process, as well as part 
of the editorial expense. This is not a 
true reduction of the publishing costs, but 
a concealed subsidy from the author to the 
publisher. 

The table on the following page 
shows the high variation in typescript com- 
position costs. The spread between low 
and high typescript costs is just as great 
as or greater than the spread between low 
and high linotype costs as analyzed in 
Chapeer sills Where is ne such thins sac ea 
fixed differential in composition cost as 
between typescript books on the one hand 
and printed books on the other. 


Area Costs and Format: (a) Size of Type 

If the variations in the composi- 
tion costs of a typescript book are the re- 
sults of different possibilities in the 
number of times the same matter is to be 
retyped, variations in area costs are re- 
Ssponsive to differences in format, to the 
number of words that are laid down on a 
page. 

Three factors control the number of 
words on a page: the size of the type face, 
the interlinear spacing, and the length of 
the line. Except when the Varityper or 
the rare micro-elite and ultra-micro-elite 
machines are used, or the text is multiplied 
by the photo-offset process, the choice as 
to size of type face is limited to pica or 
elite. The special format problems arising 
when photo-offset can be used to reduce 











typescript will be analyzed in the chapter 
CHcAaueorOce ssn 


(b) Interlinear Spacing 


Common to all typescript bookmaking, 
however, is the problem of interlinear 
spacing and length of line. Interlinear 
spacing as a problem in typescript format 
corresponds to leading in relief composi- 
tion. In normal size typescript the option 
is given between single space and double 
space. The standard ratchet, whether for 
elite or pica type, lays down six lines to 
the inch single-spaced, and three lines 
double-spaced. 

Opinions differ as to the best 
spacing of lines. According to Horde, con- 
text is so dominant a factor in legibility 
that no conclusion can be drawn from the 
relative effects of changes in size of type 
and leading; Vernon's work, # on the contra- 
ry, has led to a conclusion on spacing-- 
namely, that the best interlinear spacing 
for speed of reading book type is: 


Approximately 
1/10 inches (or 7 points) for Le=pt type 
1/14 inches (or 5 points) for ~S-ptertype: 
1/17 inches (or 4 points) for G=pel tyne: 


If elite typescript is taken as 
the equivalent of 10-point type, the spac- 
ing of the ordinary elite typewriter, when 
set for single spacing (six lines to the 
inch) comes very near to the ideal. The 
Spacing of pica typescript is too narrow 
when set for single-spacing, too open when 
set for double-spacing. But special ratch- 
ets laying down four, five, and five and 
one-half lines to the inch are available for 
the standard typewriters. The price, in- 
cluding installation charges, varies be- 
tween $1.50 to $5.00.5 An elite typewriter 
set single space or a pica typewriter set 
special space (five lines to the inch) 
probably offers the most efficient and leg- 
ible interlinear spacings. 

But since the standard typewriter 
equipment does not provide this spacing and 
the elite typewriters are distinctly less 
common than the pica, the most useful in- 
formation about formats must be worked out 
with the less efficient apparatus, namely, 


4, Vernon, Experimental Study of Reading (Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1931). How these spaces are measured 
is not clear. They probably do not correspond to the leading distances of typography, but ignore the 
descending letters (f, g, j, p, a, y). The writer has so interpreted them.

pica typescript set either single or double 
space. 
(c) Length of Line 
Experimental evidence summarized by 
Vernon shows that the length of a line 
should not be greater than 10cm.or less 
than 7.5cem. (2.9" to 3.9"). Edwards Broth- 


ers in their Manual of Lithoprinting® hold 
that a maximum length of line is determined 


by the formula N 30/72 where N is the type 
size in points--a formula which yields the 
result that 5"-5.8" is the maximum length 
of line for pica type, 6.4"—-4.2" for elite 
type. These standards yield interesting re- 
sults when applied to the smaller sizes of 
print or photographically reduced typescript. 
Por surPaleny typing in full size they sug= 
gest the conclusion which must already have 
come to the minds of many readers—-that the 
standard typewriter page 8 1/2" wide must 
be used with wide margins if the script is 





to be legible. Since under some conditions 
wide margins are wasteful, there results a 
certain disharmony between the interests of 
economy and legibility in respect of length 
of line. This waste is greater in the case 
of elite typescript, where the interlinear 
spacing is more economical, than in the 
case of pica typescript. The wasterulimess 
in length of line can be overcome by set-— 
ting up a page format in two columns-—- 
though this increases composition costs - 
even while it reduces area costs. 

In the following chapter on carbon 
copying, hectographing, mimeographing, and 
photo-offset reproduction, certain alterna- 
tive formats will be presented, together 
with the cost differentials that separate 
them. The reader can judge whether the

THE TYPESCRIPT BOOK OR MEMORANDUM: REPRODUCTION TECHNIQUES 


I. Carbon Paper Copying 
Carbon paper offers one of the old- 


est and cheapest means of multiplying type- 
script in a very few copies. It is con- 
stantly used for thesis work. With ordi- 
nary skill and an ordinary typewriter, two 
carbons can be made with high legibility 
and at a maximum price of $.05 per page per 
extra carbon. The number of legible copies 
can be increased by increasing the force of 
the typewriter stroke or diminishing the 
thickness of the paper. The Electromatic 
typewriter, which uses electric power in 
making the impression, exhibits great effi- 
ciencies here. The following table indi- 
cates the number of carbons that can be 
made with one typing and the corresponding 
weights of carbon paper and copy paper. 


gle page, are those of the paper on which 
the fair copy is made; the running costs 
are those incurred in producing additional 
carbons. 

For purposes of convenience in es- 
timating composition costs for ordinary 
typing of manuscripts, a normal cost has 
been estimated on the basis of labor at 
#.40 per hour, paper for the fair copy typ- 
ing at $1.25 per 1000 sheets, onionskin at 
$2.50 per 1000 sheets, and carbon paper at 
$2.50 per 100 sheets. Quotations received 
by the Joint Committee show that prices 
and costs are highly variable, as indicat- 
ed by Table XIII on the following page. 

A normal cost may be taken as $.40 
per 1000 words and an additional charge of 
$.02 1/2 per page per extra carbon, with

written or typed in methyl violet dye 


dye from a single master sheet. 


a) Gelatin Hectograph Process 
When a sheet of paper (which we 


will call a master sheet) bearing a text 

nS 
pressed down upon a gelatin surface, the 
methyl-violet image transfers itself to 

the gelatin. If fresh sheets of paper are 
then successively pressed against the gela- 
tin, the methyl-violet image transfers it- 
Sclim=uo them. Tis a number of copies of 
the original are produced. 

Equipment for the gelatin process 
ranges from the little gelatin pan, on 
which the menu of the thirty-five cent 
lunch restaurant is made, to a power-run 
machine with a rotary drum resembling the 
mimeograph. The Ditto, the Speedograph, 
the Vivid Duplicator, and the Standard Ro- 
tary Duplicator are among the best-known 
gelatin process machines. They vary in 
price from $15.00 for a flat-bed machine to 
$475.00 for a power-operated rotary one. 
The gelatin for the rotary models is furn- 
Wened in the form of films 9".x 15" in size, 
which are fastened to the drum of the ma- 
chine as stencils are fastened on the mimeo- 








graph cylinder; the larger, flat-bed equip- 
ment employs a roll with a cloth or fiber 
backing, 9" to 18" wide and about 15! long. 


b) Liquid Hectograph Process 
A second type of hectograph equip- 


ment dispenses with the gelatin. A piece 
of hectograph carbon paper is placed be- 
hind the master sheet, with the carbon side 
toward the master paper while the text is 
being written or typed. A reversed carbon 
image is thus produced on the back of the 
master sheet. The master sheet is fastened 
to the cylinder of the machine and the copy 
is reproduced by bringing the side bearing 
the carbon image in contact with fresh 
sheets of paper, which are moistened witha 
special duplicating fluid as they are fed 
into the machine. 

There are three kinds of liquid 
process equipment: the Ormig (Figure XX), 
made in Germany and sold for $160.00 to 
$475.00; the Standard New Process Duplica- 
tor (Figure XXI), which sells for $187.50 
to $440.00; and the Ditto Liquid Duplica- 
tor, fixed at $200.00 for the hand-run 
model and $265.00 for the power-run ma- 
chine. 


a4 METHODS OF REPRODUCING RESEARCH MATERIALS 


The Joint Committee has experiment- 
ed with both the liquid process and the 
gelatin machines. The result of extensive 
comparison in the practical working of the 
two processes is definitely in favor of the 
liquid process as against the gelatin for 
the following reasons: 


1) Quality of Product: In the gela- 
tin method, copies in the same run are 
never uniform in shade and are always light- 
er than the corresponding copies done by 
the liquid process. The age, condition, 
and preparation of the gelatin have a much 
more important effect on the quality of the 
copies done by the gelatin method than do 
the same factors of the carbon in the liq- 
uid process. 


2) Permanence: Copies produced by 
the liquid process are more permanent than 
those produced by the gelatin method, be- 
cause the liquid practically dyes the ink 
into the fibers of the paper, while the 
gelatin merely deposits the dye on the sur- 
face of the paper. 


3) Speed: The rotary liquid machine 
is capable of producing many more copies 
per minute than the flat-bed or rotary gel- 
atin equipment. The time for preparing for 
the gelatin run is almost equal to the ac- 
tual running time of the liquid machine. 


4) Simplicity of Operation: With the 
liquid method, only three operations are 


necessary-—-typing the original, clipping it 
in place, and turning the handle, or press- 
ing the foot pedal, to produce the copies. 
The gelatin machine requires much more 
preparation. 


5) Reprint Economies: Reprints from 
the original master sheet are feasible with 


the liquid process (but not recommended for 
a very long run); they are impossible with 
the gelatin method. 


6) Gelatin Supply: It is necessary 
to have on hand as many fresh gelatin films 
as there are master sheets to be run in 
close succession, for a used film must be 
allowed to stand from six to twenty-four 
hours before the dye is sufficiently ab- 
sorbed and dissipated to allow a new master 
image to be imposed upon it. If a 100-page 


document were to be hectographed by the gel- 
atin process in a single day, a supply of 
at least fifty films would be necessary. 

The variable elements in the gela- 
tin process are so much greater than the 
variables in the liquid process that exact 
cost comparisons are unreliable. There are 
no decisive reasons for expecting the gela- 
tin process to operate at a substantially 
lower cost than the liquid method. 

The prices of special supplies for 
the gelatin process are listed below. Where 
the gelatin process equipment is already 
available, it can be used; but the calcula- 
tion of the place of hectographing in the 
reproduction of typescript is based on the 
use of the liquid process.

Cost Analysis of Hectographing: (a) Com- 


position and Running Costs 
Composition and running costs for i 
hectographing require little analysis. Fair 
and format typings are merged, and composi- 
tion costs for typing may be figured at 
the normal typing rates. Labor, copy pa- 
per, and liquid charges comprise the run- 
ning costs. Liquid for the hectograph 
process is sold for $2.50 to $3.50 per 
gallon. A gallon will serve to moisten at 
least 6,000 sheets of copy paper or as 
many as 10,000 sheets; it makes no differ- 
ence whether theseare runas2e5 copies each e 
of 240 separate pages of text, or 150 cop- 
jes each of 40 different masters. The 
highly calendered copy paper required for 
the best results may be purchased for $1.65 4 
in quantities of 1000 sheets, with reduc-— 
tions in.price starting at 10,000 sheets. 
For less attractive but perfectly legible 
work, ordinary bond paper at a slightly 
lower price per 1000 sheets is satisfacto- 
ry, but as it absorbs more fluid than the 
regular copy paper it is really not econom- 
iealy, 








(b) Area Costs and Legibility 
Area costs are those of the master 


sheets ($1.50 to $3.00 per 1000 sheets) 
and the hectograph carbon paper ($.04 to 
$.06 per sheet in quantities of 100). These

costs are the ones most subject to varia- 
tion and they are the most important on ac- 
count of their relationship to legibility. 
If a saving in area costs is attempted by 
using single rather than double-spaced type- 
script to get more words on the master 
sheet, the legibility of the product dimin- 
ishes accordingly, but a more important 
consideration is the efficient use of the 
hectograph carbon paper. For the most leg- 
ible results carbon paper should be used 
only once. Of course if the typewriter is 
set for double-spacing, the carbon may be 
used the second time with no decrease in 
legibility by typing between the lines of 
PNCw irs be CODY. Carbon paper may be used 
as many as three times, but with greatly 
decreasing contrast and sharpness of defi- 
nition in the letters produced. The fol- 
lowing summary of the cost of the dye in 
relation to legibility may be made: 


a) High contrast (first use) 
$.04 to $.06 per page; average $.045 
b) Medium contrast (second use) 
$.02 to $.03 per page; average $.0225 
c) Low contrast (third use) 
$.01 to $.01 1/2 per page; average $.015 


Length of run is also a factor in 
determining the legibility of hectographed 
matter: the first few gelatin copies are 
brighter than the later ones, the diminish- 
ing contrast being due to the gradual ex- 
haustion of the supply of dye; with the 
liquid process the decrease in legibility 
begins after the 100 or 150 mark is reached. 
This diminution in contrast may be regu- 
lated somewhat, however, as the operation 
of the liquid process machines may be modi- 


fied to yield a few more brilliant copies 
or a greater number of paler ones, and as 
the carbon papers are sold in various 
grades--i.e., hard, medium, and soft-- 
adapted for runs of varying length. 

The efficiency range of the hecto- 
graph begins with the five or six copies 
where it crosses the carbon paper technique 
and runs up toward 200. Bound in place 
here are four samples of hectograph work. 
They are numbered to indicate their place 
in the run. Figure XXII is made with the 
gelatin process; note that the letters are 
smoother and more blurred than those made 
by the liquid process. Figures XXIIIa and 
XXIIIb are made with the Standard New Proc- 
ess Duplicator, one page being taken from 
an early place in a run, the other being 
selected from a later part of the run. A 
comparison of these two pages will show the 
difference in legibility of work taken from 
two different places in runs. Figure XXIV 
is made with the Ormig liquid duplicator. 
By comparing these four sample pages, the 
reader will be able to note the variations 
between the products of the gelatin and 
liquid hectograph processes, and to esti- 
mate the curve of diminishing legibility as 
the number of copies taken from the master 
sheet increases. 

The table below shows the cost of 
hectographing by the liquid process a book 
of) 100,000 words, “with typing figuredy at 
$.50 per hour, labor for running the dupli- 
cating machine figured at $.40 an hour, a

46 METHODS OF REPRODUCING RESEARCH MATERIALS 





c) Application of Hectographing to the 


Problems of Scholarship 
When compared with the average quo- 


tation for typing, these figures indicate 
that the hectograph will distribute the 
documents of internal circulation among 
scholars at prices so nearly within the 
range of those that authors are accustomed 
to assume in connection with the prepara- 
tion of their typescript manuscripts, that 
the cost of giving a limited distribution 
in hectographed form could be assumed by 
the writers themselves with little more 
trouble than they now take in distributing 
reprints of their articles from periodicals. 

An experiment in the use of this 
method as a means of reproducing doctoral 
dissertations has been sponsored by the 
Joint Committee. Dr. Stanton Davis of the 
Case School of Applied Science in Cleve- 
land prepared by the liquid hectograph 
process an edition of fifty of a 350-page 
dissértation, "Pennsylvania Politics, 1660— 
Bo, 2b es unit cost of $1.05, Additional 
expenses for binding amounted to $32.50, 
and mailing to eighteen libraries cost 
$6.72. The reader may examine this work 
at one of the following libraries:

A few copies are available for sale at the 
Western Reserve University Bookstore at 
$3.00 (paper binding) and $3.75 (cloth 
binding). The hectograph costs, exclusive 
Ce viaiGi MNeane Maia | orl sed sd omer 
fifty were $47.10 more than the cost for a 
typescript copy and one carbon. 


The hectograph process is probably 
more serviceable, however, as a means of 
distributing the type of material that would 
otherwise be printed in pamphlet form or as 
articles in periodicals. No binding costs 
other than simple wire stapling need inter- 
vene to increase the charge upon the author; 
hectographed memoranda up to twenty or 
thirty pages in length would probably find 
their place of storage in a vertical file, 
An example of this use of the process is 
the reproduction by the Joint Committee of- 
fice of Dr. Robert C. Binkley's thirty— 
four-page memorandum, "New Tools, New Re- 
cruits for the Republic of Letter," ata 
Uni teCoat sols Gen. 

Hectographing is not recommended as 
a means of preserving original source ma- 
terial because of the impermanence of the 
dye, which fades rapidly if exposed to sun- 
light for any length of time. However, the 
kind of monographic work that becomes out 
of date inthirty or forty years may be cir- 
culated in hectographed form without loss 
to scholarship from its impermanence. Ifa 
single standard carbon copy is made while 
typing the hectograph master sheet, this 
copy can be deposited and held for perma- 
nence. 


III. Mimeograph Techniques: Mimeographing 
and Direct-Typing Offset Printing 

The mimeograph process multiplies 
typescript by means of a stencil printing 
surface on which the letters of the format 
copy are cut by the typewriter. The sten- 
cil is fastened on a cylinder.) wandiac 
sheets of paper are fed into the machine an 
impression is produced on the copy paper by 
the squeezing of ink through the abraded 
portions of the stencil. The equipment 
ranges in price from $30.00 to $375. 000for 
a hand-run machine and from $255.00 to 
$450.00 for an electrically operated model 
with an automatic feed. The preparation 
of the printing surface is almost as simple 
as ordinary typewriting, and the machine 
can be operated by the lowliest office boy, 
so that although this form of duplicating 
is' commercialized by service agencies, ale 
most every office of any size possesses a 
mimeograph of its own. Both costs and 
prices, therefore, must be analyzed for 
mimeograph work. 

The rotaprint and multilith have 
been briefly mentioned in Chapter III in 











REPRODUCTION TECHNIQUES 


47 





connection with the discussion of photo- 
offset as a reprinting method. The press 
plates for reprinting are, of course, pre- 
pared photographically. But there is an 
alternative way of putting on such plates 
the format copy of the text to be repro- 
duced: the metal sheets that are used on 
these small offset presses can be inserted 
in a typewriter as if they were sheets of 
paper, to receive typescript directly. The 
making of typescript books from press 
plates prepared in this manner is called 
"direct-typing" offset, as compared with 
photo-offset. Direct-typing offset is much 
less common than photo-offset but also much 
cheaper, and it is, therefore, worthy of 
consideration by any institution possess-— 
ing sufficient resources to purchase a ro- 
taprint or a multilith for either commer- 
cial or non-commercial use. For the bene- 
fit of owmers and non-owners, both costs and 
prices will be quoted. 

From the standpoint of cost be- 
havior, mimeographing and direct-—typing 
offset are very closely related. They will, 
therefore, be referred to henceforth in 
this report as the "mimeograph" techniques, 
and their costs will be analyzed together. 


Composition Cost Analysis 
It will be seen that the cost of 


the printing surface (or the area cost) for 
the mimeograph processes, whether of stencil 
or metal sheet, is considerably more than 
the cost of the printing surface used with 
the hectograph, and that it differs from 
ordinary paper in its physical character. 
There is, therefore, a greater likelihood 
in mimeographing than in hectographing that 
there will be three typing processes. The 
author will have a fair copy made from his 
draft copy, and then a format typing will 
be necessary to transfer the text to the 
metal sheet or stencil. This is not tech- 
nologically necessary, for the typist could 
work directly from a draft copy to a mimeo- 
graph stencil; but this extra format typing 
is so often done that most of the quota- 
tions presuppose it. 

Precisely because the area cost is 
Significant in mimeographing, the problem 
of format must be studied; for it becomes 
important to lay down as much as possible 
on a given area, without unduly sacrificing 
legibility and beauty. But it goes with- 
out saying that any format differing from 


- 


the usual one-column, six-line-to-the-inch, 
pica or elite typescript format will be 
more expensive to prepare. In estimating 
the average mimeographing costs, therefore, 
format typing will be charged at $.80 per 
1000 words in order to provide for the 
slowing up that is necessary to produce an 
unusual typescript page. The specifica- 
tions for satisfactory mimeograph formats 
will be discussed in connection with area 
costs. 


Area Costs and Format 

Mimeograph stencils are of five 
kinds and are sold in two standard sizes, 
8 1/2" x Ti"and 8 1/2" x 140.9 The prices 
as standardized in the trade are given be- 
low. Bootleg dealers sometimes sell sten- 
cils manufactured in violation of patent 
rights at half these prices. The patent 
rights will expire within the next decade, 
but by that time technology may have moved 
far beyond the mimeograph. Large govern- 
ment orders are filled at discounts up to 
50% in competitive bidding.

not exceeding 500. It cannot be saved, and 
more care is needed to produce a good copy 
with the wax stencil than with the mimeo- 
type stencil. A sample of work done on a 
wax stencil is seen in Figure XXVII. The 
Cellotype stencil, a white stencil with a 
carbon back, is used when very high visi- 
bility is desired; the dermatype, a wet 
process stencil, is seldom used and is al- 
most obsolete; the mimeotype stencil, re- 
ferred to as the "universal stencil," is 
used for every purpose except the photo- 
graphic work. The dermaprint stencil has 
been discussed at length in Chapter III. 
There are two kinds of metal sheets 
that can be used directly in the typewrit- 
er--the rotaplate:-and the multilith metal 
sheet. The claim is made that the multi- 
lith sheet can be used over again for about 
three times; the rotaprint people say that 


they have not found any process whereby the 
rotaplate can be used over again with sat-— 
isfactory results.

FIGURE XXV 


Direct typing on a Rotaplate is done by using either 
a special Rotaprint carbon paper in the typewriter, a 
Rotaprint "G" ribbon, or a Royal Photo-offset typewriter 
using carbon ribbon which does not require any preparatory 
treatment, is placed in the typewriter the same as a sheet 
of paper. In the typing, a very light impression against 
the Rotaplate should be made; a hard platen that will give 
a sharp outline of the characters is best. Errors are cor- 
rected in the usual manner. 

When the typing is done, the sheet is dusted with a 
special Rotaprint powder. A small amount of liquid solu- 
tion is then poured on the sheet and spread over the sur- 
face with a piece ef cotton. The excess fluid is wiped 
off, leaving a thin coating on the surface. The Rotaplate 
is now ready to be used on the machine. It can be filed 
indefinitely. 

One Rotaplate will make 25,000 or more copies. The 
Rotaplate used for this work costs $.20. 

This sample page of direct typing Rotaprint work can 
be compared with Figure XXVI, which illustrates direct 


typing on a Multilith machine.

FIGURE XXVI 


This sample page demonstrates Multilith direct typing. MThis 
page was produced by direct typing on a Multilith Duplex plate, 
which requires no preparation to receive the image. A special 
carbon typewriter ribbon was then used and the typing was done in 
the usual manner. The plate was then run off on the Model 1200 
Multilith, at the speed of approximately 5,000 impressions per hour. 


The cost of the Duplex plate was $.25, but since it is possible 
to use both sides of the plate the cost is reduced to $.12¢ per image. 
The solutions necessary to prepare the plate for running were $.023 
bringing the total cost of the printing surface to $.15 an image in 
this form. 


The surface of the duplex plate is also receptive to crayon, 
ink. and regular fabric typewriter ribbons of the proper inking. 
The surface of this plate can be used only once to each side. It is 
possible to obtain five to ten thousand impressions from the duplex 
plate. 


The Multilith Zine plate, which has a grain on only one side, 
is also receptive to the above mentioned methods of direct work, after 
being treated with a solution of Deoxit. 


The cost of the zinc plate is $.35, but the surface of this 
plate can be cleaned, and re-employed three or four times- The plate 
is cleaned by applying a solution of Blankrolla to the surface to 
wipe out the first image. It is then resensitized with a solution 
of Deoxit. 


The life of the Multilith zinc plate direct image is from five to 
ten thousand impressions, but by the application of a solution called 
intensifier it can be extended from five to ten thousand impressions.

FIGURE XXVII 


This sample page is to illustrate the use of special in- 
terlinear spacing and the use of a wax stencil. The interlin- 
ear spacing used is five lines to the inch; the stenoil used 
is the inexpensive wax stencil costing $.05¢ each, instead of 
the usual Mimeotype stencil costing $.134 each. 

The length of run that is possible with the wax stencil 
ig much less than that which can be obtained with the Mimeo- 
type stencil, possibly 300 copies being the limit. 

The preparation of the wax stencil printing surface is 
no more difficult than the Mimeotype printing surface. The 
chief danger is the creasing of the wax sheet, which would re- 
sult in ink being squeezed through the abraded parts. Correc-

FIGURE XXVIII 


This is a sample page done with micro- 
elite type. In this format, 800 words are 
contained on one page. Compare this figure 
with Figure YXVII, containing 400 words per 
page and using special interlinear spacing. 

To mimeograph a bxok of 100,000 werds 
in this format would mean tremendous savings 
in stencil cost and paper east. Composition 
cost would, of course, be no less, and might 
even be somewhat more expensive, due to the 
two-column arrangement. 

The inference, of course. is ebvious: 
there is a close tieup between cost and leg- 
ibility. The more money that is put into a 
job, the more likely it is that the result- 
ing product will have greater legibility and 
be more pleasing to the eve. This brings up 
the problem of how we are to determine the 
exact point at which cost. legibility. and 
beauty of appearance come together in the 
best balance. This problem has not yet re- 
ceived its final analysis. It is known. 
however. that beyond a certain point there 
is no need to spend more money for increased 
legibility. because the factor of legibility 
has already reached its maximam point. and a 
more expensive format would add to nothing 
except, perhaps, the printer's profit. 

In order to exhibit as manv as possible 
of the different varieties of the mimeograph 
process, sample pages have been run off on 
various paper stocks from Rotaprint and lMul- 
tilith metal sheets, and from Vimeotvpe and 
wax stencils. The reader mst make all-w- 
ance for the fact that paper stocks, formats 
and processes are all on display, and mst 
decide for himself which differences in the 
sample pages are due to formt variahles. 
which to paper, and which to the reproduc- 
tion methods. , F 

The mimeograph process multiplies type- 
script by means of a stencil printing sur- 
face 9n which the letters of the format copy 
are cut by the typewriter; the stencil is 
fastened on a cylinder. and as sheets of pa- 
pae are fed into the machine. an impression 
is produced on the copy paper by the squeez- 
ing of ink threugh the abraded pertions of 
the stencil, Mimeograph equinment ranges in 
price from $30,00 te $375.00 fer hand-run 
models, and from $255.00 te $45f.00 for the 
electrically operated models with automatic 


feed. The preparation of the printing sur- 
face is almost as simple as ordinary tvpe- 
writing, so that, although this form of dup- 
lication is commereially available through 
service agencies, almost every office of any 
size possesses its own Mimeograph machine. 

The Rotaprint and the Maltilith have 
been mentioned in connection with the dis- 
cussion of photo-offset as a reprinting 
method. The press plates for reprinting are 
prepared ochotegravhically, of eourse, but 
there is an alternative way of putting on 
such plates the format cooy of the text to 
be repr-duced. The metal sheets that are 
used on these small cffset presses can he 
inserted in a tvoewriter as if they were 
sieets of paper, to receive typescript di- 
rectly. The making of typescript books from 
press plates prepared in this manner may 
perhaps be called ‘direct tvoing" offset, as 
compzred with photo-offset. It is much less 
common than photo-offset, tut also much less 
expensive, and it is therefore worthy of con- 
sideration by any institution possessing suf- 
ficient resources to purchase a Rotaprint or 
&amp; Maltilitn for either commercial or non- 
commercial use. 

From the stand »oint of cost behaviour, 
mimeograpning and direct typing offset are 
very closely related. Thev will therefore 
be referred to in this report as the ''mim- 
eograph'' techniques, and their costs will 
be analyzed together. 

This is a sample page done with micro- 
elite type. In this format, 800 words per 
page are accomodated. Compare this figure 
with Figure "XVII. containing 400 words per 
page and using special interlinear spacing. 

To mimeograph a book of 100,000 words 
in this format would mean tremendous sovings 
in stencil cost and paper cost. Composition 
cost would, of course, be no less, and might 
even be somewhat more expensive, due to the 
two-celumn arrangement. 

The inference, of course, is obvious: 
there is a close tieup tetween cost and leg- 
ibility. The more money that is put intoa 
job, the more likely it is that the res »l1t- 
ing product will have grenter legibility and 
be more plevsing to the eye, This brings up 
the oroblem of how we are to determine the 
exact point at which cost, legibility, and

By combining these factors in vari- 
ous ways, there might be constructed over 
fifty different typescript formats. The 
difference in word-carrying capacity be- 
tween the two extremes is very great. A 
hundred thousand words would go on 12% pages 
oo 61/2" x 14" size, elite type, single 
spaced, 6 1/2" lines, narrow-margin format; 
but would require 562 pages of 8 1/2" by 
11" size, pica type, double-spaced, 5" 
lines, and a wide-margin format. 

By a combination of experiment and 
guesswork, the writers have reached the 
conclusion that the formats shown in 
Table XIX are advisable for the number of 
words per page indicated. 


Explanation of Sample Pages and Cost Table 
In order to exhibit as many as pos- 
sible of the different varieties of the 
mimeograph process, the sample pages fol- 
lowing have been run off on mimeograph and 
bond paper of different weights, from rota- 
print and multilith metal sheets and from 
wax and mimeotype stencils (Figures XXV to 
XXVIII). The reader must make allowance 
for the fact that paper stock, format, and 
process are all on display; and he must 
decide for himself which differences in 
the exhibits are due to format variables, 
which to paper, and which to the reproduc-

hypotheses regarding composition cost: 
first, that the format copy is typed di- 
rectly from the draft copy without an in- 
tervening fair copy; and second, that the 
fair copy is made on paper and then re- 
typed as format copy on the mimeograph 
stencil. Labor for operating the duplicat 
ing machine is estimated at $.40 per hour. 
The choice of format would control a vari- 
ation in area costs of 350% from the mini- 


mum and a corresponding variation in run- 
ning costs. (See Table XX on the follow- 
ing page.) 

These are costs based on average 
estimates for office work; prices vary 
greatly from this calculated cost basis. 
The comparison of cost and price, i.e., of 
work done in an office and work sent out, 
can be seen in one instance in the compari- 
son as shown in Table XXI, page 52.

REPRODUCTION TECHNIQUES 53 


IV. Photo-Offset from Typescript 
The photo-offset technique has al- 


ready been described in connection with the 
reprinting of books out of print. The same 
technique is available for the reproduc- 
tion of typescript. Why should it be used, 
however, when typescript can be multiplied 
without an intervening photographic proc- 
ess? 

The difference between the direct 
and indirect making of a typescript print- 
ing surface can be illustrated in compar- 
ing the two possible ways of using the 
multilith. By the first method the typist 
takes a metal sheet, coats it with a prepa- 
ratory solution, puts it into her typewrit- 
er exactly as if it were a piece of paper, 
bypes the text on it, clips it to the drum 
of the multilith and reproduces it. By the 
second method the typist makes a copy with 
a strong black ribbon on paper. An opera- 
tor photographs this typescript page, se- 
curing a negative on film or paper--in this 
case usually paper. Then the photographic 
negative is laid on the metal, which has 
meanwhile been sensitized, and strong arc 
lights burn in the text from the photo- 
graphic negative on to the metal plate. 
Then at last the metal plate is put on the 
drum, and the multiplying of copies can be- 
gin. The additional work increases not 
only the labor time but also the labor 
rate, because the additional photographic 
skill is necessary. Why should the costs 
of all these intermediate steps be borne? 
Why should the area cost be so greatly in- 
creased when the end product is still a 
typescript book? 


Justification for Increased Area Cost 

If the text includes illustrations 
or characters that must be filled in by 
hand, or certain kinds of tabular or chart- 
ed data, the reason for using the photo- 
graphic step is clear. If, however, the 
text is simply typescript and nothing else, 








the justification of the extra cost must be 
found elsewhere. 

There are three reasons for incur- 
ring this additional area cost: first, the 
plates of the larger offset presses are too 
big to be put into the typewriter; second, 
the better photo-offset presses will dis- 
tribute ink more evenly and make finer let- 
ters than the mimeograph techniques (includ- 
ing direct-typing offset) will produce; 
third, the standard typescript relations of 
type size, length of line, interlinear spac-— 
ing, and size of page are not related to 
the normal 10" spacing of library shelving 
in a way that results in the most efficient 
use of page areas and bookshelf footage. 


Photographic Reduction of Typescript: 


(a) Economies in Type Size 
Typescript is wasteful of page 


areas because of the large size of the type. 
Photo-offset permits a photographic reduc- 
tion of typescript in any degree.* There- 
fore, by the photo-offset process a type- 
script can be brought down to the equiva- 
lent of 8- and 10-point type as used in 
books, or to the equivalent of 7-point 
newsprint. A table of equivalents was sug- 
gested in Chapter IV, by which various re- 
ductions of typescript could be correlated 
with corresponding point sizes of book type 
by a photographic process. 

There has been one direct study of 
the legibility of reduced typescript by 
Professor Greene of Michigan. Professor 
Greene came to the conclusion that what he 
called "seven-point typewriter type" (i.e., 
pica typescript reduced to 70% of full size 
so that it laid down fourteen letters to 
the inch instead of ten) was just as legi- 
ble as full-sized pica typescript.® 

The reader should be given an oppor- 
tunity to test this judgment and to compare 
the legibility of typescript in various re- 
ductions with the legibility of book-face 
type. To make the comparison possible, six

areas of four square inches each are filled 
with reading matter (Figure XXIX). The 
first square is filled with text in 10- 
point type, and typescript that will lay 
down the same number of words in the same 
area is set beside it; the second pair of 
squares is filled with pica typescript re- 
duced to 80% of normal size, and with ordi- 
nary printing in 7-point type, which fills 
the same area with the same number of words; 
the third pair of squares shows that pica 
typescript must be reduced to 70% of full 
size to put the same number of words in the 
area that will be put there by ordinary 
newsprint. The reader may judge the com- 
parative legibilities. 

Whatever conclusions the reader may 
draw from these illustrations and from the 
exhibits of standard photo-offset type- 
script formats as to the permissible amount 
of reduction which pica typescript will 
take without sacrifice of legibility, the 
essential fact stands that reduction in 
size of typescript increases very rapidly 
the number of words that can be laid on a 
given page area. While the linear dimen- 
sions of the typescript are falling by an 
arithmetical ratio, the number of words per 
page is increasing by a geometrical ratio. 
This is the same situation that is encoun- 
tered in any photographic reproduction 
process in which a reduction of the size of 
the writing is involved. 


Photographic Reduction of Typescript: 


(b) Length of Line and Economy 
There is an additional feature that 


makes this consideration especially impor- 
tant in the case of typescript, and that is 
the effect of reduction on length of line. 
there is very little reason to\carry outra 
reduction of typescript size if a single 
column of typescript is still to be carried 
on a sheet of paper 8 1/2" x 11", because 
so much of what is gained in the use of 
space by diminishing the type size is sim- 
ply turned over to wider margins. But here 
two possibilities intervene: the reading 
matter may be typed in two or more columns 
and reproduced on the standard typewriter 
size page, or the size of the page itself 
may be reduced to something more nearly re- 
sembling that of an ordinary octavo book. 

But since an octavo page, 6" x 9", 
with lines of maximum length (3.9" for 6- 
to 10-point type, according to Vernon) 








sacrifices 35% of its surface to right- and 
left-hand margins, an 8 1/2" x 11" page, 
with two columns each 3 1/4" wide, which 
sacrifices only 23 1/2% to right- and left— 7 
hand margins, is preferable. The differ- 
ence is increased by the fact that a larger 
side margin usually calls for larger top 
and bottom margins. Since the cost of 
printing surface is an area cost and the | 
margin space costs just as much per square 
inch as the part of the page that is uti- 
lized for text, it is especially important 
in planning an economy format for a photo- 
offset typescript book that the margins 
shall not be made any larger than necessary. — 
It is interesting to note in this connec- 
tion that Edwards Brothers propose, for an 

8 1/2" x 11" page, a two-column format with 
columns 3 1/2" wide, and the Donnelley &amp; 
Sons Company suggests a similar format. 

With these facts in mind, one may 
lay down the conditions under which it may 
be profitable to reproduce typescript by 
photo-offset rather than by the mimeograph 
process: by the increased utilization of 
paper and printing surface owing to reduc- ~~ 
tion in size of type, and the diminution of ~ 
the proportion of area given over to mar- 
gins, the photo-offset process will at some ~ 
point reach a cost figure that will make up 
for some of the additional costs of the 
photographic element in the process. 
for instance, the area cost of making a 
photo-offset page is three times the area 
cost of making a mimeograph page, the area 
cost per word will be the same only if six 
times as much reading matter can be put on 
the photo-offset page.

Specifications for Reproducing the Same 
Book at the Same Cost by Mimeographing and 
by Photo-Offset 

Cost comparisons between photo- 
offset and mimeographing as means of repro- 
ducing typescript are complicated by the 
fact that photo-offset is usually shopwork 
sent out on contract, and, therefore, costs 
to the publisher must be calculated on the 
basis of actual price quotations by firms 
engaged in the printing business; while the 
mimeograph process is so much a part of of- 
fice routine that its costs can be calcu- 
lated in terms of labor and materials. The : 
most appropriate comparisons, therefore, are © 
those that stand between commercial mimeo- — 
graphing as quoted by office service shops .

and commercial photo-offset quotations. 

A further complication increasing 
the difficulty of cost comparison is the 
fact that any format devised to secure a 
maximum use of the paper surface is likely 
to require a special format typing; the 
fair-copy typing operation cannot so easi- 
ly be merged with the format-copy typing as 
in the processes which use a simpler for- 
mat. In both cases, therefore, the cost of 
a format typing from the fair copy will be 
figured into the estimates made. 

An extra operation required to 
justify the right-hand margin also calls 
for calculation, whether the method used 
should be that of a second format typing 
or the special paper invented by Spielvogel 
(see Chapter IV). The cost of this opera- 
tion will not be figured into the esti- 
mates. 





Taking all of these factors into 
account, it seems that mimeographing 50,000 
words in a format that permits 300 words to 
the 8 1/2" x 11" page would cost about the 
Same as reproducing the same number of 
words by photo-offset in a format that re- 
produces 1786 words to the 8 1/2" x 11" 
page. 

As in all problems of reproducing 
research materials, the rule holds that be- 
tween certain limits an increase in attrac- 
tiveness of text and format accompanies an 
increase in cost. Above the level at which 
photo-offset typescript costs the same as 
mimeographing, there are other photo-offset 
formats available at costs that increase 
until they come to exceed the cost of effi- 
ciency formats in printing. 


Photo-Offset Typescript Format: 
lization of Printing Surface 
In planning formats for the photo- 
offset book there must be considered a 
fixed set of dimensions not those of the 
typewriter page--namely, the dimensions of 
a metal sheet of the offset press. Though 
Commercial quotations often ignore this 
factor, it actually enters into the cost in 
avery material way, for whenever a format 
is so designed that it fails to use the 
full available printing surface of the 
photo-offset metal sheet, energy and materi- 
al are wasted. The sensitizing and prepa- 
ration of the metal sheet are substantially 
the same whether all or merely a part of 
the surface is used; the waste that occurs

when the page is not planned to fit the 
metal sheet has been discussed in Chapter 
III in connection with reprinting. 

The ideal typescript format, from 
the standpoint of printshop efficiency, 
would be based on a page size that would 
divide evenly into the area of one of the 
larger press plates. The plates most com- 
monly in use will take paper sheets of the 
following dimensions:

This consideration is of great im- 
portance in the case of a long run, but if 
only 200 or 300 copies of a book are de- 
sired, the cost of the paper is so slight 
an element in the total cost that paper 
economy may in some cases be sacrificed in 
the interest of printing surface economy. 

The relative importance of econom- 
ies in utilization of metal sheet area and 
economies in utilization of paper is estab- 
lished by the fact that the first is a sav-— 
ing in area cost, the second a saving in 
running cost. The smaller the edition, 
the larger is the proportion of area cost 
and the smaller the proportion of running 
cost, and hence of cost of paper. In the 
small editions—-around 100--the area cost 
so far preponderates over running cost 
that some firms give the same quotation for 
HOONCopLes as ore s0copilesr. In such 
editions wasteful use of paper is 


56 


justified if it will bring equivalent econ- 
omies in the use of the photo-offset metal 
sheet. The exact point at which it will 
cease to pay to waste paper for the sake of 
saving metal sheet printing surface can al- 
ways be calculated by estimating the total 
price of the paper wasted and comparing it 
with the area cost saved. 

What then is an ideal format for 
the photo-offset typescript book? The 
standard octavo printing formats (accord- 
ing to published figures on binding) of 
6" x 9" and 6 1/4" x 9 1/4" are ill adapted 
to offset work because they lead either to 
an undue extent of margin, an undue length 
of line, or an inadequate use of the re- 
ducing power of the photographic process. A 
column of maximum width (3.9") can be 
printed in the 5 1/2") x 8 1/2" page witht 
only 42.4% of the area surrendered to mar- 
gins, but this volume is too small for con- 
venient library shelving. The best format 
for library shelving convenience and low 
margin ratio would be just short of 10" 
high, and the narrowest page that would ac- 
cept two columns would be 7 3/4" wide. Such 
a page would take two columns of minimum 
width (2.9") with 1/2" between them, and 
external margins of about 3/4", The per- 
centage of area given over to margins would 
be about 26%. The book page would have an 
unusual appearance--more nearly square than 
an ordinary octavo page. Yet it would be 
very efficient (Figure XXX). 

Now the curious fact emerges that 
despite all the variety of sizes available 
in photo-offset press, there is none that 
will take without waste of printing sur- 
face al page 9.3/4". =e 773/4".. “Thus the lim 
itations of equipment impose themselves in 
planning a model photo-offset page. 

Planning a photo-offset page is 
more intricate than planning a mimeograph 





page because, while all the variants of 
length of line, interlinear spacing, mar- 
gins, size of type, and number of columns 


are present, there are added the addition- 
al factors of a photographic reduction ra- 
tio and a layout on a photo-offset metal 
sheet. The format copy is typed on one 
size of page, the book appears in another 
size of page. Moreover, while the use of 
book type in planning a page has been made 
the subject of much study, the use of type- 
script with photo-offset has been left to 
rule of thumb. 


METHODS OF REPRODUCING RESEARCH MATERIALS 


To illustrate the planning of a 
photo-offset page, an exercise is here car- 
ried out in calculating a format for a book 
of 50,000 words to meet two different cost 
situations: first, to cost as’ much minvau 
edition of 500 as low-cost printing; sec- 
ond, to cost as much in an edition of 500 
as medium-cost mimeographing. By consult- 
ing the tables in Chapter III, it appears 
that an edition of this size, in an "econc= 
my format," can be printed at $365.00 
(6 3/4" x 9 1/2" page size, two columns); 
and the same text, mimeographed in a 400- 
word format, will cost $158.00 (see page5l). 

The question may then be asked, is 
photo-offset as expensive as printing? Is 
it as cheap as mimeographing? The answer 
is-that iteis both, and! thay thescoc ssc. 
pends on the format. The format is itself 
the determinant of legibility, and anyone 
with a typewriter and a supply of paper can 
plan a format that will meet any price 
level from the lowest to the highest. 

The general formula for finding a 
photo-offset format that will reproduce a 
given number of words for a given sum of 
money in an edition of a given size can be 
worked out from data already presented in 
this volume. 

Given N (a number of words) and D 
(a sum of money available), from the in- 
formation in Chapter IV on costs of typing, 
calculate the cost of making a format copy 
of this number of words, which will be D! 
(the composition cost). D minus D! will be 
available for photo-offset work--the area 
and running cost. From the tables in Chap- 
ter III, calculate the number and size of 
photo-offset pages that can be produced in 
the required number of copies for D minus 
D' dollars. Then lay off on these pages 
the desired margins, make a decision on the 
number of columns of print, and conclude 
with the dimensions in inches of space to 
be filled with text. Let L be the length 
of the column, W the width of the column, 

P the number of pages, and C the number of 
columns to a page. 

N/CP is the number of words per 
column. The type of text may lead to the 
conclusion that the number of keystrokes 
per word is greater or smaller than six, 
but six can be taken as a good average. To ~ 
keep the formula perfectly general, however, 
let K be the number of keystrokes per word 
(including allowance for inter-word spacing

A PROJECT FOR THE REPRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION OF 


MATERIALS FOR RESEARCH IN SMALL EDITIONS 


under consideration by the 


Joint Committee on Materials for Research 


of the 


American Council of Learned Societies 


and the 


Social Science Research Council 


I. The Problen. 

The term, materials for research, is 
here understood to refer to materials of 
three types: (1).reprints of out-of-print 
or rare items, =&lt; books, pamphlets, news- 
paper or periodical files; (2) source mat-~ 
erial of considerable bulk, which in most 
cases would be copied and edited, but in 
some cases, merely reproduced in facsim- 
fle; (3) the original work of scholars, 
generally in the form of monographs. 

Such materials for research are at 
present published by agencies of three 
types, each specializing in publications 
for which a sale of different size may be 
expected: (1) commercial publishers or- 
dinarily issue books of which a thousand 
or more copies will be sold; (2) univer- 
sity presses specialize in books with a 
total sale averaging less than a thousand 
copies; (3) learned societies for the most 
part issue books with a total sale of 
less than three hundred copies. 

Since the cost of printing materials 
for research can seldom be covered by a 
sale of less than four hundred copies at 
normal prices (1.2 cents per page, or 375 
words for a cent), almost all such publi- 
Cations as the learned societies now issue 
must be subsidized, usually to the extent 
of two-thirds of their cost. Books issued 
by the university presses, of which as 
many as six hundred copies are sold, must 


also ordinarily be subsidized, to the ex- 
tent of one-third of their cost. Nor is 
the need for subsidies confined to agencies 
of the second and third types: 
publishers have frequently found it neces- 
sary to ask subsidies for books for which 

a sale of a thousand copies cannot be anti- 
cipated. In fact, experience has shown 
that the publication of materials for re- 


commercial 


search is seldom possible at present with- 
out a subsidy to cover at least a part of 
the loss incurred. 

The small sale for these publicat ions 
is probably due in the last analysis to 
the rapid advance of specialization, which 
has so far removed from general knowledge 
publications that are essential to further ° 
advance as to restrict their appreciation 
to specialists. But the restricted market 
that they might command is still further 


| diminished by the apparent preference of 


American scholars for depending on libra- 
ries to obtain the materials they need, 
rather than for purchasing them for persone 
al use. So long as this preference pre- 
vails, provision will have to be made for 
reproducing and distributing materials for 
research in the small editions that the 
market can absorb, if material essential 
to the progress of research is to be made 
available for the use of scholars. 

For most publications of this kind, 
subsidies will in any case be necessary,

and loss of keystrokes at the uneven right- 
hand margin). Then NK/CP is the number of 
keystrokes per column. 

The formula for making NK/CP key- 
strokes on a reduced size (or enlarged size) 
photo-offset column of given dimensions 
L x W inches can be worked out for any 
typewriter. 

Let A be the number of keystrokes 
per inch laid down by the typewriter (so 
that with a pica machine, A equals 10; 
with an elite machine, A equals 12; with a 
micro-elite machine, A equals 14; with a 
"nine-pitch" machine, A equals 9); and let 
B stand for the number of lines to the 
inch (which with ordinary single spacing is 
six, with double spacing is three, and 
with special spacings may be four, four and 
one-half, five, and five and one-half). 

Given chosen values for A and B, it 
remains to find W' and .L!, the width and 
length of the original typescript copy of 
a column from which the photo-offset page 
is to be photographically copied, in a re- 
duction ratio or enlargement ratio which 
will have the value R. 





The composition costs of typescript 
books, it has been proved, are highly vari- 
able; the principal levels for a book of 
50,000 words are determined by the five 
situations shown in Table XXIII. 

To simplify cost calculations, com- 
position cost will be taken for the third 
situation only--i.e., for typing done by a 
typing bureau at an average price. The 
typescript composition cost for photo-off- 
set will therefore stand at $62.50 for 
50,000 words. Although the differences in 
format will react upon this composition 
cost in some measure, this influence will 
be ignored. Substracting, then, the com- 
position cost from the two total sums sug- 
gested as alternatives (i.e., price of a 
mimeographed and price of a printed book), 
the following amounts remain for the pro- 
duction of a photo-offset book, exclusive

58 METHODS OF REPRODUCING RESEARCH MATERIALS 





In Chapter III area costs of photo- 
offset work are found. These indicate that 
the sums listed above will purchase the 
following amounts of page area in a photo- 
offset edition of 500 copies: 

For $95.50 can be bought 500 copies 
of twenty-eight pages, 8 1/2" x 11", which 
will require 1786 words to a page to repro- 
duce 50,000 words; or, $95.50 will buy 500 
copies of forty-four pages, 6" x 9 1/2" 
(twenty-two printings from a metal sheet 
9 1/2" x 12"), which will require 1136 
words per page to reproduce 50,000 words. 

How can the typescript copy be pre- 
pared to lay this number of words on a page 
in a format satisfactory for photo-offset 
in these sizes of metal sheet or paper? 

The arrangement of 6" x 9 1/2", 
less 1/2" margin on top, bottom and out- 
side, and with a 3/4" margin on the bound 
edge, can be made in this manner: two 
columns, each column 8 1/2" high, carrying 
568 words, in column width not greater than 
21/8", leaving 1/2" between columns. Such 
a column will roughly resemble newsprint 
in width. Counting 6 keystrokes per word 
to allow for spacing and loss on the right- 
hand margin, the number of keystrokes must 
be 3408 in a column 8 1/2" x 2 1/8". An 
interlinear spacing of five lines to the 
inch with pica type would be used. 

In full pica size, 8 1/2" will be 
filled with forty-two lines at five lines 
to the inch, and 2 1/8" with 21 keystrokes; 
at full size, therefore, this area will ac-— 
cept 882 keystrokes. But since it must ac- 
cept 5408 keystrokes in reduced size, the 
reduction must be such that four times this 
number of keystrokes will go on this area. 
The square root of four is two. The pica 
typescript must, therefore, stand at a re- 
duction of two diameters. Since 42 key- 
strokes reduced two diameters will fill the 
21/8" column, the typewriter should be 
set to make columns of this width (42 key- 
strokes, or 4.2") and carried to a column 
length of 17". When this is reduced photo- 
graphically, it is a reduction of approxi- 
mately 50%. (Figure XXXI.) 

In the 8 1/2" x 11" size of page 
the necessary 1786 words would probably 
best be set in three columns. Making mar- 
gin allowances of 3/4" inside margin, 1/2" 
between columns and for outer margin, and 
1" on the top and bottom, the effective 
width of the columns would be 2.08" and the 


Each column would be 
required to take 595 words, or 5570 key- 


height would be 9". 


strokes. A reduction ratio of 50% will be 
necessary. Pica typescript reduced to 50% 
of original size will suffice in this for- 
mat. In the format copying, the typist 
should make each line 443 keystrokes long 
(4.3") and the column should be typed to 
18" in height. (Figure XXXII.) 

Thus it appears that there are at 
least two formats in which a photo-offset 
copy of a 50,000-word text could be made 
for a price equivalent to the cost of a 
mimeograph copy. The choice of an 8 1/2" 

x 11" format would involve reduction of 
pica typescript by 50%; the choice of the 
6" x 9 1/2" format would also mean a reduc- 
tion of 50%. The typescript format copy 
for the 6" x 9 1/2" page could be prepared 
on a typewriter with a 12"-carriage (two 
columns, each column 4.2", with 1/2" mar- 
gin between them); the format copy for the 
8 1/2" x 11" page would call for a type- 
writer carriage that would make three col- 
umns, each 4.5", with two internal margins 
of 1/2", and hence a 15"-carriage would be 
necessary. Of course the typing could be 
done one column at a time on the typewriter, 
and the columns then mounted together to 
make the format copy. 

The essential significance of this 
whole demonstration is, first, that photo- 
offset formats can be designed to bring 
photo-offset costs down to the level of 
mimeographing; and second, that when for- 
mats are so designed to bring the photo- 
offset costs to this level, the legibility 
diminishes below that of the corresponding 
mimeograph copy. Pica typescript reduc- 
tions of 50% are close to the lower limit 
of legibility without a reading glass. 

If the composition cost is set ata 
lower level by basing it upon a wage rate 
in an office, the number of 8 1/2" x 11" 
pages upon which the 50,000 words would be 
spread would be increased from twenty-eight 
to thirty-two, because there would be more 
money left over from typescript composition 
to pay for the photo-offset work. It would 
then be necessary to put only 1560 words on 
a page instead of 1786, only 520 words ina 
column instead of 595. This could be ac-— 
complished by reducing the typescript only 
47%, toc5oe. Oram tSetul mest ze,

lowing $62.50 for the composition cost, a

ning costs. This amount of money will buy 
500 copies of forty-four pages, size 6"

pages, there must be 1136 words on a page, 
or 568 words per column in a two-column 
format such as this one. 

To fit these specifications, the mas-

is necessary either for the mimeographing 
of 50,000 words or for the photo-offset- 
ting of 50,000 words in this format, is 
probably best used for the mimeograph. 

Using Hoch's figures, as given in 
Chapter III, it is found that $95.50 will 
buy twenty-eight pages of size 84" x 11".

Again, as has been explained in the 
text, it is possible to give a larger pro- 
portion of the $158.00 to the running costs 
by either doing the typing personally and 
not counting the cost in, or by having it 
done by cheap labor. However, it is 
quite possible that the typing would be of 
such inferior quality that the amount 
saved for running costs would be much bet-

special spacer. Five lines to the inch is 
used for this format, instead of the usual 
six lines to the inch (regular single

legibility, or the three lines to the inch 
(regular double spacing) which is too wide- 
spread to be economical.

This photo-offset page is made up in a format that costs 
the same to reproduce as an economical print format. The 
$365.00 that would be required to print 50,000 words is here 
devoted to making a photo-offset reproduction from typescript. 
$62.50 of it is allotted to the composition cost, leaving 
$302.50 to pay for the running costs. This amount will buy 
500 copies of sixty-nine pages, 93" x 12", or, as with this 
format, 138 pages, 6" x 93". With the larger size page, only 
725 words need be put on each page; with this 6" x 93" page, 
only 363 words need be put on each page. 

Leaving wide margins and typing in a single column with 
four-lines-to-the-inch spacing, a reduction of 33% takes care 
of the word content. The resulting page is a very legible 
and very expensive way of putting the photo-offset process 
Imtomuse™. 

If it should happen that the format copy were then sent 
to a photo-offset printer for quotation who was using a press 
with a 17" x 22" metal sheet, his quotation for the job would 
be substantially higher than the figure of $302.50 that is 
the basis of this calculation, because he would have to run 
the whole printing surface to get four pages of 6" x 93", 
and the wastage of his metal sheet printing surface would be 
almost 40%. This fact is brought into the picture to empha- 
size the importance of considering, in the planning of a for- 
mat, not only the arrangement of typescript columns that will 
lay the required number of words on a page, but also the rela- 
tion of the page size chosen to the dimensions of the metal 
sheet of the press upon which it is to be run.

Assume that on pay day, January 4, $440.00 is paid to workmen. This payment 
would represent the discharge of a wage liability of $250.00 already on the books (the 
credit balance in the Wages Expense accowmt), and the payment of $190.00 labor expense 
of the new period. The entire $440.00 should be charged to the Wages Expense accounts

The balance of the account, $190.00, is the correct wage expense for the new pe 
riod. | 
Other examples of accrued expenses are advertising, commissions, interest, sal 
aries, workmen's compensation insurance; also the utility services, gas, electricity, 
and water. 
Adjusting entries for accrued expenses are necessary, for, without such adjust 
ments: 


- the expenses of the period will be understated, 

- the net income overstated, and 

- the balance sheet will be incorrect because of the omis-— 
sion of accrued expenses from its liability side. 


DEFERRED INCOME 

Some incomes may be recorded on the books before they are earned. Suppose foi 
instance, that an insurance company credits Insurance Income for an initial annual pre 
mium of $2,400.00, which it receives on December 1, from a new policy holder. When tl 
books are closed December 31, it would not be correct to consider all of the $2,400.00 
as income earned in the period ending that date. This is because the insurance prote 
tion is rendered not for one month but for twelve months. It follows that since 1/12 | 
the insurance protection is rendered during December, 1/12 of the income, or $200.00, 
should be credited to that month. The remaining 11/12ths, or $2,200.00, should be cret 
ited to the income of the new year. . 

A statement of principle may therefore be made: income which has been record 
on the books but which is, in whole, or in part, unearned income at the end of an ac-— 
counting period, should be removed from the income account of the -current period and ¢ 
ried forward to the next period as unearned, or deferred, income. The accounting en 
tries are as follows: 

Income accounts are debited with the amowmt to be deferred, and the credits ar 
made either to separate liability accowmts,--one account for each type of deferred in 
come,--or to one summary account called Deferred Income. The latter method is ordina- 
rily to be preferred. Unless further-other adjustments are necessary, the income ac- 
counts are closed to Profit and Loss, and the account with Deferred Income is carried 
to the balanee sheet as a liability. It is a liability because it isvan oplipation 
which is payable, not in cash, but in services.

are levorotatory. The hydrochloride is 
easily soluble in water. The systemic ac- 
tion and the toxicity are similar to that 
of cocaine, the local anesthetic action 
being, however, more marked. This was 
confirmed in human eyes by Hagen who found 
that in opposition to cocaine, even solu- 
tions of 0.5 per cent cause complete anes- 
thesia. With 5 per cent solutions the ef- 
fect is also more lasting than with co-

printing shop for quotations, and that the 
quotations for a printed product are about 
the same as those for a photo-offset book 
from typescript. This is invariably the 
result of the choice of format for the 
photo-offset book. The printing prices, as 
has been proved in Chapter III above, can- 
not respond as actively to change in for- 
mat as the photo-offset prices. To ask "is 
photo-offset as expensive as printing?" is 
to avoid the essential element in photo- 
offset pricing, namely area cost and re- 
duction ratio of the typescript. By calcu- 
lations corresponding to those used above, 
it is easy to determine a format in whicha 
typescript book, reproduced in 500 copies 
by photo-offset, will cost as much as_ the 
same book reproduced in print. 

If the $365 that would be required 
to print 50,000 words is devoted to making 
a photo-offset reproduction from typescript, 
$62.50 of it must be allotted to typescript 
composition, leaving $302.50 to pay for the 
photo-offset work itself. This will pay 
etor 500 copies of 69 pages, 9 1/2" x 12", 
Bor 158 pages, 6" x 91/2", It would be 
‘necessary to put no more than 725 words on 
each 9 1/2" x 12" page, or 368 words on 
each 6" x 9 1/2" page. Leaving wide mar- 
‘gins and typing in a single column with 
five-lines-to-the-inch spacing, a reduction 
of 24%, to 76% of full size, would take 
care of the 9 1/2" x 12" page. The typist 
would simply set the stops to write 85 key- 
strokes to a line (8.56"), type 60 lines on 
a page, and ask the photo-offset printer to 
reduce the page to 76% of full size. On 
the 6" x 9 1/2" page, the typist would set 
the stops to write 54 to 55 keystrokes, 
type 47 lines at four-lines-—to-the-inch 
Spacing, and ask the printer to reduce it 
33% to 67% of full size. (See Figure 
XXXIII.) The resulting pages would be very 
neat, very legible, and a very expensive 
way of using the photo-offset process. 

If it should happen that the format 
copy were then sent for quotation to a 
_photo-offset printer who was using a press 
with a 17" x 22" metal sheet, his quotation 
for the job would be substantially higher 
than the figure of $302.50 that is the ba- 
sis of this calculation, because he would 
_have to run the whole 17" x 22" to get four 
pages 6" x 9 1/2", and the wastage of his 
metal sheet printing surface would be al-

picture to emphasize the importance of con- 
sidering, in the planning of a format, not 
only the arrangement of typescript columns 
that will lay the required number of words 
on a page, but also the relation of the 
page size chosen to the dimensions of the 
metal sheet of the press upon which it is 
to be run. 

In the first edition of this manual, 
the writer gathered quotations on the manu- 
facture of photo-offset typescript books 
and fitted them to a chart in which they 
were compared to the manufacturing prices 
of printed books. It has become evident, 
as a result of further study, that this way 
of presenting the comparison is completely 
misleading because it ignores the vital fac- 
tor of format. Therefore, in this analysis 
of the use of photo-offset to reproduce 
typescript, several formats are designed, 
and the manufacturing prices of a book in 
each format are calculated. These prices 
are sufficiently checked with actual quota- 
tions to make them indicative of the gener- 
al price levels at which photo-offset can 
be used. (See Figures XXXIV and XXXV.) 


Photo-Offset from Normal Fair Copy, with- 


out Additional Format Typing 
It will often happen that a fair 


copy of a manuscript has been made in the 
ordinary typescript format, 300 words to 
the page. This question then arises: shall 
the text be retyped as a special format 
copy for photo-offset reproduction, or shall 
the fair copy be used as a format copy? 
This is a special case of the problem of 
controlling typescript composition costs by 
merging fair and format typing operations. 
It can now be given a specific answer. 

A manuscript of 50,000 words, typed 
in the normal 300-word format, fills 166 
pages. To retype this manuscript in a spe- 
cial format for photo-offset reproduction 
would cost $62.50. Now this $62.50, if di- 
verted from the payment of composition cost 
to the payment of area cost, will buy nine- 
teen extra pages, 81/2" x 11", or 28 
extra pages, 6" x 9 1/2", in an edition of 
500. If this $62.50, instead of going to 
composition, is actually paid to the offset 
printer, the text can be spread over this 
additional amount of page area without 
changing the total cost of the edition. The 
additional page area released to the photo- 
offset by an elimination of the retyping

process is the same, regardless of the to- 
tal amount spent for the publication. 
Whether the book is to be published for 
Pipe O0nor fori$ses.00;, et wilt etid a be 
true that the money diverted from composi- 
tion cost will buy exactly the same amount 
of additional photo-offset surface. 
Will it pay to make this diver- 
sion? Will retyping so greatly increase 
the efficiency in the use of photo-offset 
page area as to justify reducing the num- 
ber of available pages upon which the text 
is to be reproduced? This special case of 
the fair copy-format copy problemis particu- 
larly important, because the 300-word for- 
mat is the normal one in which typescripts 
are prepared, and in which they are pre- 
sented to editors or bound as typescript 
dissertations. 
It has been shown above that the 
50,000 word text can be retyped and repro- 
duced in a 6" x 9 1/2" or an 8 1/2" x 11" 
book for $158.00 (the same price as mimeo- 
graphing) by reducing the pica typescript 
to..50%. of full size. 
If the entire $158.00 is spent for 
photo-ofiset work, it will buy six full 
sheets 22" x 34" ($153.66). These six 
sheets will divide into 168 pages of 5 1/2" 
x 4 6/7", This particular way of folding 
the sheet will cause an additional expense 
in gathering, but the extra expense will 
probably not exceed the difference between 
$153.66 and $158.00. The normal typescript 
pages, reduced to go on pages of this size, 
must pass through a reduction of 45%, leav- 
ing them 55% of full size. The page would 
then have a 1/2" margin top and bottom, and 
side margins of nearly an inch. This re- 
duction ratio would be the same if the 
typescript pages were reduced to go on 
pages 5 1/2" x 4 1/4", made by folding 
8 1/2" x 11" sheets into four, and costing, 
for the edition, $133.40. The difference 
between $133.40 and $153.66 would be an un- 
necessary expense for needless width of 
side margins. The alternatives in the 
"ear-—print" reproduction of a fair copy 
of normal typescript are therefore: 
1. To retype and mimeograph 
($158.00) 

2. To photo-offset without retyp- 
ing, reducing to 55% of full 
size ($133.40) 








3. To retype and photo-offset, re- 
ducing to 50% of full size 
($158.00). 

Another standard price level is sug- 
gested by the dimensions and word count of 
the normal typescript page, because of the 
importance of utilizing the full area of 
the photo-offset metal sheet. This is the 
size 8 1/2" x 5 1/2", obtained by reducing 
a full page of typescript to a half page of 
photo-offset. Metal sheets that will take 
an 8 1/2" x 11" page without wastage will 
also take the 8 1/2" x 5 1/2" without wast-— 
age. If top and bottom margins of 3/4" are 
left on the photo-offset page, the reduc-— 
tion of the typescript will be 23%, to 77% 
of full size, and the cost of the edition 
of 500 will be $265.00. This isianprice 
level at which the innumerable bound theses 
that fill the shelves of graduate schools 
could be brought conveniently into print 
without retyping. 

If the: sum of $265.00) ts ton be 
spent to reproduce typescript in a retyped 
format, it can be made to yield a two- 
column page 8 1/2" x 11", with each column 
3.6" wide, and 1/2" margins top and bottom, 
in exactly the same reduction, namely 23%. 


Therefore the cost of reproducing 
a_ typescript by photo-offset in a reduc- 
tion of 23% would be the same, whether or 
not the additional format typing were 
done. The saving of page area involved 
in shifting from one column to two, and 
from normal double spacing to special spac-— 
ing four and one-half-to-the-inch, and 
from the 3/4" to the 1/2" top and bottom 
margin, would exactly pay the cost of the 
format typing. 

These figures make possible an in- 
teresting comparison with the actual price

The Edwards! model 700-D requires 
seventy-two pages for the 50,000 words; the 
Edwards! quotations for typing in this for- 
mat are $.78 per 1000 words instead of the 
$1.25 which is the average figure. The com- 
position cost is figured at $39.00 for the 
700-D model with 50,000 words. The price 
of an edition of 500 copies typed by the 
author is $225.00; the price of an edition 
typed at the shop is about $39.00 more (or 
$264.00). Edwards quotes $265.00 for the 
shop-typed copy. 

There are other contrasts to be ex- 
amined. The Hoch quotations for 500 copies 
Ore page 6 1/2" x ll" stand at $5,205 
Edwards prints this amount of matter, col- 
lates, and includes a cheap binding for 
$3.68. But the Hoch quotations show a con- 
stant proportionate relationship between 
the prices of full metal sheets and half 
sheets. If Edwards Brothers sets up the 
8 1/2" x 11" area in the form of two pages, 
8 1/2" x 5 1/2", the price is equivalent to 
$3.92 instead of Hochts $3.20. Of course 
the collating and binding cost counts for 
something in this comparison, but the fig- 
ures reveal nonetheless a certain elastici- 
ty in costs per square inch of page (area 
costs) and in running cost behavior. 

The buyer of photo-offset service 
ean conclude from these illustrations that 
it is wise to secure quotations separated 
imto the three parts: 

1. Area costs (page area chosen to 

fit metal sheets) 

2. Running costs (quoted as a con- 
stant figure per additional hun- 
dreds of copies) 

S. Typing costs (quoted in thou- 
sands of words, or in pages ofa 
specific format) 

With these quotations in hand, he 

can divide the work and plan his format to 
produce maximum legibility at minimum cost. 


Typing Instructions 

Since these tables reveal a consid- 
erable difference in costs and prices de- 
pendent upon the character of a composi- 
tion cost, instructions for the preparation 
of a format copy for the photo-offset type- 
script book are properly a part of this 
chapter. 

Since the typescript copy must bea 
photographic object it should be as black 
as possible. Some companies recommend the 


METHODS OF REPRODUCING RESEARCH MATERIALS 











use of a special bronze ribbon; in all cases 
the ribbon should be fresh and black. To 
avoid an uneveness in the impression pro- 
duced by the fabric of the typewriter rib- 
bon a special silk ribbon or one made of 
carbon paper may be used. The typewriter 
type must be perfectly clean and the touch 
of the typist even; the Electromatic type- 
writer may be used to great advantage here. 
Format instructions as to line 
length, interlinear spacing, etc., are most 
easily followed out if paper with a printed 
margin line can be provided, clearly de- 
signating the typing area. Photo-offset 
printers often provide such sheets. With 
paper so marked, and with the right ratchet 
and ribbon on the typewriter, and the right 
paper on the roller, any standard typewrit- 
er and any normally efficient typist should 
be able to turn out superior work. 
There are two ways of preparing 
typescript for the two-column page. The 
copy can be typed directly on a large sheet 
marked off into two columns or upon a long 
one-column galley, to be cut and fastened 
on the two-column page backing with rubber 
cement. The former is perhaps the better 
method in handling copy which is absolutely 
"straight"--no footnotes, no illustrations, 
no probability of author's revisions. But 
if the design of the page requires so many 
letters per column that the two columns 
cannot be typed together on the normal 10"- 
carriage, or if there is a prospect of many 
corrections or of footnote material to be 
fitted in place, the galley strip method of 
typing is probably superior. 
All corrections may be made with 
shears and rubber cement. The new matter 
may be placed on top of the old, or else 
the deleted matter may be cut out and the 
new matter pasted in its place. 
Paste pot and shears will also 
serve to make page proofs of galley proofs. 
The paper for the page proof should have a 
strong line running down the middle if the 
final copy is to show the two columns di- 
vided by a line. Diagrams, photographs, 
and other non-typescript matter can be fit- 
ted into the pages at this stage in the 
preparatory process.

GQ SPECIMEN PAGE OF @ SCRIBE BOOK 


For the artistic reproduction of a manuscript an alternative to the- 
use of the usual type faces and of typescript presents itself that is as 
intriquing as it is simple. This alternative is the preparation by a trained 
scribe of the copy to be photographically reproduced by the photo-oftset or 
photo-gelatine. processes. 

‘The transition from writing to printing only gradually changed the ap- 
pearance of book pages. The first printers, in fact, strove to make their 
books as nearly like manuscripts as possible. The Blasius copy of the Gutenberg 
Bible is said to have been represented as a manuscript by John Fust and to 
have been sold as such in Paris. The early printers designed type faces~ 
which imitated the form of letters with which they were familiar. ‘The- 
German printers copied the pointed style which later acquired the name 
of gothic and which had been used during the Middle Gges for produc- 
ing the psalters, missals, breviaries, and the Bibles of the Church. The 
talian printers developed a face in the humanistic style: a round, neat 
Script coming in with the Renaissance. This style became known as— 
roman and reached its greatest perfection under Nicholas Jenson. Only 
gradually were type faces designed which were quite unlike the writing 
of the copyists of the Middle Ages. 

With the mass production of the twentieth century, there has come 
a standardization of type faces which tends to minimize the individuality 
of a book. But with the application of photography to printing the u- 
nique quality of the writing of trained scribes can recapture the artistry 
of individual workmanship. The books prepared by scribes possess a 
personality all their own. G conspicuous example of such a book is~ 
that produced by Gnna Simons, the Sonetti, Ballate. Sestine of Dante 
Qlighieri in the Bibliotheca Manu Scripta. The cost of creating such 


books, of course, would vary with the individual scribes. ” a

working clothes; others we expect to see 
parading in formal dress. Typescript and 
newsprint are the clothes that thought 
wears in its daily work; the typography of 
book manufacture is its more formal attire. 
But the formal dress that thought acquires 
in book typography is only a ready-made 
Suut atter all: calligraphy offers to 
elothe thought in much richer and more 
beautiful tailor-made attire, which should 
have a higher prestige value than book ty- 
pography. 

The beauty of the manuscript has 
been increasingly appreciated as the cen- 
turies have confirmed the triumph of let- 
terpress. Precisely the same qualities 
that make printing more attractive than 
typescript would tend to make manuscript 
more attractive than printing. There is 
more chance for close adaptation of letter 
Beorm to the spirit of the text, more chance 
for creative artistry. 

The twentieth century has already 
developed its scribes. The influence of 
Edward Johnston, author of the foremost 
general book on illuminating and lettering 
aligl English, ° has been felt not only in the 
beautification of typographical design but 
also in the growth, especially on the Con- 
‘tinent, of a school of artists in whose 
work calligraphy meets creative literature, 
Pictorial, art and bookbinding in a prod- 
uct which adapts medieval craft to modern 
design.

penman like Rudolf Spemann, is, however, a

small, with the result that the average 
person seldom sees and never possesses a 
manuscript book. 

But now a new prospect opens: the 
manuscript can come back in current pub- 
lishing; the graphic arts are prepared to 
make it available to the common man. Photo- 
offset will multiply any black on white for- 








mat copy, whether prepared by relief print— 
ing, typewriting or calligraphy. The inex- 
pensive photo-offset press may make possi- 
ble a production of manuscript books as a 
special smalim=scale craivus) thie art of the 
scribe can now return, relieved from the 
rule of constant costs which placed it) -at 
such a disadvantage in competing with di- 
Mnishine costs of the printing crart. Ihe 
illustration on the preceding page serves 
to show what might be done in this line. 
(Figure XXXVI.) 


Cost Analysis: Composition Costs 


The area and running costs of a 
manuscript book reproduced by photo-offset 
do not differ from those of any other kind 
of book reproduced by this technique. The 
difference comes in composition costs, 
which naturally are high as compared with 
those of typescript and linotype work. 
There are no set prices for handwritten 
master copy, but an estimate of 1200 words 
per day at $3.00 or thirty pages a week for 
#20.00 was made for the Joint Committee. 

These prices would naturally be 
prohibitive for the 50,000-word book chosen 
as a standard for the other pages in this 
chapter. They would be reasonable, however, 
for the reproduction of current literature 
--say, a small volume of poetry. The repro- 
CWC PLOMe One CUIMReMtb es IeiiZe rang near Indy voll Smet ram 
might have an interesting effect upon cul- 
ture, for it might help to implement cul- 
tural decentralization away from the great 
metropolitan centers. It would have little 
bearing, however, upon the problem of re- 
producing research materials except as 10 
would help to deprive book typography of 
its privileged place as an arbiter of in- 
tellectual quality.

CHAPTER VI 


BLUEPRINTING, PHOTOSTATING, AND ALLIED TECHNIQUES 


Van Dyke and Lithoprint (First Costs High; 
Running Costs Low) 
A number of techniques have been 


developed for the copying of architects! 
drawings, maps, and other non-textual mate— 
rial, but adapted to certain problems in 
the reproduction of texts. In these copy- 
ing techniques it is a question of decisive 
importance whether the original from which 
the copy is to be made is a positive or neg- 
ative, and whether the copies are desired 
in positive or negative form. 

There are two processes resembling 
the photolithographic and photogelatin proc- 
esses, but adapted to the reproduction of 
large black—-on-white drawings or maps. The 
first is the reversing positive or Van Dyke 
process. It sometimes happens that there 
will be some advantage in making a photo - 
offset metal sheet directly from a black-— 
on-white original. This is especially like- 
ly to be useful in the reproduction of maps. 
A British army engineer by the name of Van 
Dyke devised a method for preparing a metal 
sheet without a photographic negative of 
the master copy. 

The process is first to coat the 
metal sheet with bichromated fish glue and 
then to make a photographic print on it 
from an original tracing or photopositive 
instead of a negative. The glue is hard- 
ened, not on the lines and letters, but 
around them. On the lines and letters the 
metal is cleaned bare. If such a sheet 
were put directly on the press it would 
print a black background, leaving the let-— 
ters white, for the bare metal would accept 
water and the glue would accept ink. 

But the printing quality of the 
surface can be reversed by an ingenious de- 
vice. First, the whole surface is covered 
with ink, no part of it being moistened 
with water. The bare metal, unprotected by 
moisture, takes as much ink as the hardened 
glue. If the sheet were used in that state, 
it would cover the whole paper solid black. 


65 


Then comes the reversing step. Some 
of the ink is sticking directly to the met— 
al; the rest is held to the metal only by 
the film of glue. If the glue is eaten 
away, the ink will fall off. An acid bath 
will attack the glue without touching the 
ink that has adhered directly to the metal. 
The metal sheet is immersed in acid, and 
when the acid has done its work the hard- 
ened glue falls off, bearing the ink with 
it. The metal then shows a surface of 
lines or letters formed in ink with bare 
metal between them. If this sheet is put 
on the offset press and the bare metal mois— 
tened with water, it will print like any 
other photolithographic sheet. The inked 
parts of the metal continue taking ink, the 
moistened parts continue taking water and 
rejecting ink. 

A process which has been called 
Ordoverax and is given the name Lithoprint 
by the Lithoprint Company of New York, Ine., 
4] Warren Street, New York City, is the 
second of these methods. As dermaprint ar- 
rives as a gelatin adaptation of the mimeo— 
graph, so the Ordoverax process appears as 
a gelatin adaptation of blueprinting tech- 
niques. The process does not seem to have 
much currency in America except in the books 
about techniques, but its possibilities are 
interesting. A gelatin-covered plate is 
reduced to a gummy condition at a low tem-— 
perature. An exposed but undeveloped blue— 
print will transfer its lines to a gelatin 
surface so that the gelatin surface will 


‘become differentially receptive to ink, 


like a developed photolithographic metal 
sheet. The same result can be obtained by 
bringing a gelatin surface into contact 
with a certain chemical ink. Typewriter 
ribbons can be impregnated with the active 
chemical. The process ought to fit very 
well in the no-man's land of reprinting 
techniques between five and twenty-five 
copies. It is curious that the principle 
has not been developed as an improvement 


66 





of the hectograph, for the hectograph al- 
ready uses a gelatin surface. Price data 
on the process are not easily obtainable, 
nor are the writers certain of any firm 
that uses it, although certain blueprint 
firms claiming to do work by "secret" proc- 
esses may be using this one. 

The Van Dyke process is used prin- 
cipally for map work, the lithoprint method 
for multiplying drawings upon linen. The 
costs of both processes act like normal 
book production costs: there is a large 
initial cost in preparing the copy anda 
smaller running cost for the production of 
additional copies. The Lithoprint Company 
charges $.06 per square foot in quantities 
of six copies or over, with a minimum 
charge of one square foot for each drawing. 
The purchaser does not get the advantage 
of declining costs with the increase of 
edition size beyond six. 

A third process, which is known by 
several trade names, uses a direct—on-trac-— 
ing-cloth method. It is a process whereby 
a Van Dyke negative is employed. The Van 
Dyke negative is placed upon a sensitized 
tracing cloth, which is exposed to light 
in a vacuum frame, developed, and washed. 
From this waterproof tracing cloth, a num- 
ber of blueprints can be made, and the need 
for hand tracing is entirely eliminated. 
Prices for tracing-cloth reproductions 
start at $.65 per square foot, with reduc-— 
tions in price starting at fifty square 
feet. 


Blueprinting and Photostating (First Costs 
Low, Running Costs High) 

Most of the processes of the blue- 
print type exhibit a different kind of cost 
behavior, resembling manuscript costs of 
the period prior to the invention of print-— 
ing. The second copy costs almost as much 
as the first copy; there are very small 
savings to be obtained by increasing the 
size of the edition. This situation is 
normal in all those photographic processes 
which count upon sensitizing the surface 
of the paper that is to be used rather than 
sensitizing the printing surface and then 
printing with ink on ordinary paper. The 
machinery for making copies by these proc-— 
esses is always some kind of frame in which 
the original and the sensitive paper are 
held in contact and exposed to light. The 
costs are usually quoted in square feet. 





METHODS OF REPRODUCING RESEARCH MATERIALS 





The differences are principally differenc-— 
es in the character of the sensitized sur- 
face spread on the paper. 

There are two ways of transferring 
an image to sensitized paper: directly, by 
holding the sensitive surface in contact 
with the text that is to be copied and 
forcing the Jight through Acs indinreciviiva 
by using a lens, and reflecting light from 
the text to the sensitized surface. The 
most common of the direct methods is the 
blueprint technique, the most common of the 
indirect methods the photostat. The direct 
methods always reproduce the original with- 
out altering its size; the indirect methods 
permit enlargement or reduction. 

There are four kinds of sensitive 
surface that are used commonly for making 
copies "directly" by light transmitted 
through the master copy (i.e., blueprint— 
ing). These are: 


1. Ferroprussiate (blueprint) 
Ferrogallic (indigo black print 
or gallic- print) 

3. Sepia, sometimes called Van Dyke 
Ozalid and BW paper 


The ferroprussiate sensitive paper 
for blueprinting is often manufactured by 
the blueprinting companies themselves, ac-— 
cording to various formulae which yield 
surfaces of different degrees of sensitiv— 
ity. It is darkened by exposure to the 
light and fixed by washing in water. The 
ferrogallic print is made in the same way, 
but it is more costly and is not usedsmuch 
in this country. It also has the disadvan- 
tage that it is not permanent and that it 
requires very careful timing of exposure 
to prevent spoilage. The sepia print sur- 
face is sensitized with silver salts and 
therefore bears a certain chemical resem- 
blance to photastat paper. All these sen- 
sitized surfaces are alike in that they 
will make a white-on-dark copy of a black-— 
on-white object. Ozalid paper is exposed

BLUEPRINTING, PHOTOSTATING, AND ALLIED TECHNIQUES 


permit a variety of results in copy- 
ing by one or another of the blueprint 
techniques. The original copy must 


always be a strong black-on-—white, and 
the paper or cloth must be reasonably 
translucent. By making from this orig- 
inal black-on-white a white-on-brown 
sepia (Van Dyke) copy, and then using 
the white-on-brown "negative" sepia 
copy for producing additional blue 
sepia (Van Dyke) "positive" prints, 
the blueprint technician can produce 
copies that resemble the original in 
being dark on a white ground. The B-W 
process is simply a short-cut to this 
result. 


or 


In the terminology of the trade, a 
"blueprint" is always a print in which 
white lines appear on a blue ground. 
meviersemomeasbiluepring as a "bite dine 
print," in which blue lines appear on a 
white ground. The B-W process yields a 
black line on white, and Ozalid gives a 
deep red line on white. In making a blue 
line print, it is customary to make first 
a Van Dyke negative (white lines on dark 
ground), and then, in a second exposure, 
make a blue line print from the Van Dyke 
negative. If a dark brown line is desired 
instead of a blue line, the paper used in 
the second exposure is the more expensive 
Van Dyke or sepia. The blue line and the 
brown line prints cost more than ordinary 
blueprints because they must be run more 
slowly through the machine. A photostat 
negative can be used in making a blue line 
or Van Dyke print, but the results are in- 
ferior. If, however, the photostat nega- 
tive is made with a "paper negative" pa- 
per, suchvasthe Kodalith or Photostat N 
paper, the results are equal to those ob— 
tained with a Van Dyke negative. 

The production of blue line or Van 
Dyke prints from paper negatives offers 
very interesting possibilities in the re- 
printing of books in very small editions. 
Unfortunately, it is impossible to get ac-— 
CUnaveu prices dave, lor Ghescost, of produc— 
tion of paper negatives of this type is al- 
ways included in the price of photo-offset 
work, The paper negative that can be used 
in the blueprint technique is exactly the 
same as the paper negative used in photo- 
offset work. Since prices are not quoted 
in the trade, it is necessary to make es— 
timates of cost. 


The 








67 





The cost per square foot of paper 
negative is about three times the cost of 
photostat paper. The paper negative can be 
purchased in long rolls and used in the 
photostat. The cost of changing from one 
paper to the other in a photostat would be 
substantial, but it would be absorbed if 
the total amount of work to be done would 
be enough to use up a whole roll of paper 
negative--500 to 500 square feet. Apart 
from the loading of the roll of paper, 
there should be no labor costs to render 
the paper negatives more expensive than 
photostat negatives. The formula for the 
lowest reasonable price for paper negatives 
should therefore stand about as follows: 
multiply the cost of the paper by three and 
add the same non-paper cost (labor, chemi- 
cals, overhead, profit) that is shown on a 
photostat price list. An ordinary photo-— 
stat 8 b/2") x TL" costs $.85 a pege if one 
to five pages are ordered, and $.15 a page 
if 100 or more are ordered. There is no 
point in considering the production of a 
few pages, because of the labor cost of 
changing the paper in the machine. In the 
100-page unit, the cost of photostat paper 
is $3.34, while the price of the finished 
photostat zopies is $15.00. If the higher- 
priced paper negatives were used instead of 
photostat paper, the paper cost would be 
about $10.00, or $6.66 more than the ordi- 
nary paper; then the price of the finished 
copies could not be less than $21.66, and 
would probably be more. 

Another way of figuring the differ-— 
ences is to consider the quoted price of 
photostats utilizing a roll of paper 450! 
lo Lhe wordinanryaspaper waco sitsech Lele Om don 
this amount, and the paper negative $50.50. 
This amount of paper is used in photostat 
work that, at ordinary prices, costs $119.00. 
The substitution of paper negative for ordi- 
nary photostat paper should increase this 
price by $31.80, bringing the total to 
$150.80 instead of $119.00. It is evident 
that the paper negative must cost about 50% 
more than the ordinary photostat paper. If 
the trade should develop business in this 
line, the differential would probably be 
greater, but for purposes of estimating in 
this chapter, the 50% differential will be 
used. It will be assumed that if photo- 
stats could be made for $100.00, the same 
material could be put on paper negatives 
for $150.00.

Maximum Use of Area 

The standard dimensions in which 
square footage measurements and prices are 
calculated in the blueprint industry are 
shown on the chart. Any area over 42" in 
width gives rise to a surcharge. The ordi- 
nary book or typescript page is too small 
a unit area to utilize the blueprint eco- 
nomically, but pages can be pasted togeth- 
er in large sheets to fit one or another 
of the fixed dimensions that are the basis 
of the price structure. Thus it would cost 
$.03 to blueprint a page 6" x 9"; but if 
four such pages were pasted together, the 
area of 18" x 12" would be blueprinted for 
$.045, a price per page of $.0125 instead 
Cree. OS. 

The master copy for a book to be 
reproduced by the blueprint technique 
should always be envisaged as a large sheet 
consisting of pages pasted together. The 
large sheet can then be folded and cut and 
bound with the fold at the outside edge-- 

a style of binding used in Chinese book pub-— 
lishing. This makes a book with each page 
doubled, so that the blank surface is fold~ 
ed in. The blueprint book will then offer 
the reader the convenience of a book with 
printing on both sides of the page. Anoth- 
er method is simply to cut up the large 
blueprint sheets into separate pages. 

In blueprinting, as in photo-offset, 
the master copy can be a photostat negative. 
It may be an enlargement or a reduction 
from the size of the original text. The 
principle of maximum utilization of area 
requires that the pages be of such size 
that they will fit without wastage on one 
of the blueprint areas. Blueprint repro- 
duction is well adapted to the production 
of editions of less than fifty copies. 


Prices per Square Foot 

Without losing sight of the fact 
that the copy must be made to fit the stand- 
ard dimensions of the industry in order to 
obtain effective square footage prices, the 
calculation of the cost of multiplying 
texts by the different blueprint techniques 
can be made from the following price list. 

Though the blueprint processes have 
not been used in book production, they have 
been used in a number of cases to duplicate 
records. They have been called into serv-— 
ice by college registrars to make tran- 
scripts of academic records. Mr. Daniel 


Rich of the University of Michigan has com- 
piled a statement of the relative merits 
of the B-W process and the photostat for 
making these copies. Registrar E. B. 
Stevens of the University of Washington 
found that he could make copies of tran- 
scripts at $.075 each by the B-W process, 
counting cost of labor and material. There 
is a society which collects biographical 
material by interviews with prospects who 
are flattered by being told that they are 
distinguished people. The society then de- 
posits the biographical notes in a central 
office, from which it offers to distribute 
B-W copies. These uses of the B-W process 
indicate a most interesting quality. When 
material is deposited in the form of loose 
sheets written in strong black on the right 
kind of white paper, the B-W process will 
permit the making of inexpensive copies of 
the original upon demand. 


Copying of Documents without a Camera 


a) Direct Contact Copying 
There are two ways of directly 


copying documents without the use of a cam- 
era and, hence, without reduction or en- 
largement. If the original document is 
printed on one side of the page and the 
page has a fair degree of uniformity and 
transparency, a contact print can be made 
from it directly and using a minimum of 
equipment if a paper such as Insurance 
Bromide (sold by Eastman), Ad Type paper 
(Eastman), or Kodalith paper (Eastman) is 
used. This is a valuable process for the 
individual scholar who may wish to make 
copies with a minimum of equipment, whether 
in his own home or study or where photostat 
service is not available. It is a process 
well-suited to the copying of music written 
on one side of the sheet, for the musician 
may wish to make a photographic copy of 
borrowed sheet music. 

The cost of materials is simply the 
cost of the photographic paper plus the 
chemicals. The equipment is cheap and con- 
sists of a safelight, printing frame, or 
sheet of thick plate glass, and convenient 
dishes for developing, washing, and fixing. 
Any darkened room will serve for the work. 
It should preferably be equipped with elec-— 
tric lighting so that two points or a dou- 
ble plug are available, one for any ordi- 
nary electric light bulb and the other for 
the safelight or red bulb lamp.

__ BLUEPRINTING, PHOTOSTATING, AND ALLIED TECHNIQUES 


In the case of documents which have 
become yellow with age, improved results 
ean often be obtained by printing through 
a yellow glass such as the Wratten No. 12 
filter or the Wratten Series 00 safelight. 
In such a case the prints are best made on 
@ paper sensitive to green light such as 
Kodalith Ortho or Insurance Bromide. Even 
a lighted match can serve as a source of 
tight in this; direct method. 

In copying an ordinary page, say of 
typescript, a piece of photographic print- 
ing paper is laid face up and the typescript 
paper face up on top of it. The two are 
held together with a piece of glass or in 
a printing frame, and the light is turned 
on over them for the appropriate time. The 
paper is then developed and fixed and comes 
out as a negative copy not unlike a photo- 
stat copy, though with less definition and 
ComuGeaSive sine Idetinitionwis not so good 
because the thickness of the photographic 
paper comes in between the surface it is 
desired to copy and the sensitive surface. 
imecthe paper is very thick, or of very 
close texture, or very dense, then it will 
be practically impossible to obtain good 

sharp negatives in this way. In these cir- 
cumstances it will be necessary to place 
the printed side of the page in contact 
with the sensitive paper, print for the re- 
quired time, and develop to a negative 
which will be laterally reversed. In order 
wOmsecure a tinal positive, a contac print 
will have to be made from this on another 
Sheet of paper. 


b) Reflection Copying 

If the page from which the copy is 
wonbe made is printed on both sides, then 
a different process is necessary. Clearly 
it would not be possible to print through 
the page. The process to be employed in 
this case is known as the "reflection copy- 
ing" or "reflex" process and was original- 
_ly known as the "Playertype" since it was 
imsh pul vO practical use by an English— 
man named Player towards the end of the 
last century. 

In this process a piece of black 
paper is placed under the page to be copied 
and a piece of photographic paper of high 
contrast and orthochromatic, such as 
Kodalith Ortho (Eastman) or Insurance Bro- 
mide, on single weight support is placed 
mrace down on top of it with the emulsion 





z Wr 
side of the photographic paper in contact 
with the printed surface it is desired to 
reproduce. The two must then be pressed 
into very close contact with a heavy piece 
of plate glass or in a pressure printing 
frame. This can be helped by using a thin 
sheet of felt behind the black paper under 
the page to be copied. The exposure to 
light is made through the beck side of the 
photographic paper, the exposure depending, 
of course, on the light source and the dis-— 
tance from it and the speed of the paper 
used. isthe Copy ob vained iin bhils way ass 
developed, fixed, washed, and dried, it will 
be a laterally reversed image of the page, 
and it can be used to make an unreversed 
positive copy of the page by making a con- 
tact print from it on another piece of pa— 
per. It is not absolutely necessary to 
make a positive, although it is usually 
more convenient to do so. The negatives 
may be read by a transmitted light, espe- 
cially if the paper is on a fairly translu-— 
cent single-weight support. The contact 
print from the original negative can be 
made while the negative is still wet after 
washing, and in this way time can be saved. 

The contrast in this process can be 
improved considerably if the original nega- 
tive is made by printing in yellow light 
rather than white light. For this purpose

The Photostat 

The best established of the copying 
methods on photosensitive paper is the 
phetostat method. In the photostat as) in 
EACeDLUeprlnbe PROCESSES, stew uN LUECOSt does 
not diminish as the size of the edition in- 
creases. But it can be made to diminish by 
reducing the dimensions of the pages copied, 
and hence cutting down at once on the legi- 
Dino ce unem MMs eC mp rod lGiman Gm rulemeliticnd 
of the photographic paper used. This 


Le 


METHODS OF REPRODUCING RESEARCH MATERIALS 





possibility raises in connection with the 
photostat the same problem of reduction of 
type size that appeared in connection with 
photolithography. 

In photostating, operating and 
equipment costs both enter into considera— 
tion, for the photostat apparatus is often 
owned and operated by research institutims 
themselves. 

The costs of photostatic copies 
are governed principally by the cost of 
the photostat paper. The price per square 
foot of a light-weight stock is about $.04, 
But in the preservation of research mate- 
rials use may be made of the special "H" 
or "HH" grade of permanent paper stock, 
manufactured by the Byron Weston Company. 
The "H" grade, which is coated on one side, 
sells for $.052 per square foot; the "HH" 
grade, which is coated on both sides and 
hence will bring a saving of half the cost 
of binding the volumes, sells for $.092 
per square foot of paper or #.04 3/4 per 
square foot of sensitive surface. 

When wastage has been taken into 
account and the variations due to the dif- 
ferent ways of imposing the negative and 
cutting the paper from rolls of different 
widths has been reckoned with, the cost of 
paper for photostating a 100—page book in 
different page sizes and with different 
grades of paper is as follows below. 

To these costs of paper there must 
added the costs of labor and chemicals. 
The New York Public Library and the print-— 
ing department of the Cleveland Bell Tele- 
phone Company very kindly contributed 


statements of their operating costs. In 
the New York Public Library the great ma- 
jority of the prints were 11 1/2" by 14", 
usually one copy only, and the average cost 
of the paper was $.055. In the Telephone 
Company the average size of paper was 

8 1/2" x 11", and in many cases several 
copies of the same coject were required. 
The cost of the paper averaged $.03 per 
page. In the Public Library the $.055 
worth of paper requires so much reference 
and clerical work that the cost of the fin- 
ished print rises to $.193 each. In the 
Telephone Company, where only operating 
room charges need be considered, the #.03 
worth of paper is worked up into a print 
which costs *.063. This means that labor, 
depreciation, and chemical supplies cost 
#.033. These operating room costs in the 
Public Library amount to $#.06. ‘The figures 
in total operating room cost are as follows:

The Public Library spends an additional 
#.082 on every page to cover clerical help, 
postage, and desk supplies--charges which 
are due to the special character of the

library work. The inescapable operating 
costs are 10% more than the cost of the pa- 
per and may be more than twice the cost of 
the paper. This percentage is reduced as 
the work becomes more continuous. The life 
insurance companies operate with highly 
standardized copy; their labor costs should 
be very low, but the writer has not been 
able to secure statements from them. The 
work of the Massachusetts Historical So- 
ciety in copying colonial newspapers made 
MsewOr tie photostay at its highest effi= 
ciency for the reproduction of research 
materials. A letter from the director, Mr. 
Worthington C. Ford, explains the financing 
of this enterprise: 


e.ewe gave our operator the highest 
photostat salary paid within my 
knowledge and with that the cost of 
material represented twice the cost 
GuelaDOr. Ly roughly Nestamated! that 
Porcos&gt; US snout $.15 1/2 to make a 
page of a newspaper of the large 
size...but we printed some which re- 
quired the largest size of sheet 
adaptable to the photostat machine, 
and the average cost was not in- 
creased. We sold the newspapers at 
a fixed price of #.15 per page. Some 
years there was a profit of #300- 
#400 and some years we came out even. 


Similar newspaper photostating by the Uni- 
versity of Michigan Library and John Carter 
Brown Library are being carried on at a 
rate higher than that charged by the Mass-— 
achusetts Historical Society. The Library 
of Congress estimates that its photostat 
copies of foreign archive material cost it 

-*.15 each, and the British Museum and 
Bodleian Libraries show a cost of #.06 a 
page quarto size. It can be concluded 
that every dollar's worth of photostat pa- 
per requires from $.50 to $1.10 in operat-— 
ing expenses. 

Commercial prices for photostating 
service are standardized on the basis of 
four sizes: 8 1/2"-x 11"; 11" x 14; lan 
Palo; sand 16" x 24". The price fails 
with the number of pages copied, from the 
high of #.25 a page (8 1/2" x 11") when 
one page only is copied, to the low of 
¢.15 when 100 pages are copied. The fol- 
lowing table charts the prices of any num- 

' ber of pages from one to 100, in any of

the four sizes. The price falls by $.01 a 
page with every increment of five pages. 
This table will be used in making estimates 
of cost of photostat work, although actual 
photostat service may be available at low- 
er prices in some places, or may cost more 
elsewhere. A spread of two book pages, 6" 
x ON, will go on a photostat page 14" x 18". 
If slightly reduced in size, two pages 
would go on one photostat page 11" x 14", 

The "number" is the number of photo- 
stat sheets, and may be either duplications 
of the same pages or reproductions of suc-— 
cessive pages of a book. The price is the 
total price of the number of sheets, but 
opposite each price group is a unit cost 
figure indicating price-per-page. 


Photocopying Equipment 


The two appliances which compete 
in the field of photographic copying are 
tne photostat (Figure XXXVIII) and the 
Rectigraph (Figure XXXIX). The photostat 
is the better known and has succeeded in 
making a common noun of its trade name. 

The differences between the two kinds of 
apparatus do not seem to be sufficiently 
important to have a decisive effect upon 
costs but are worth noting because they il- 
lustrate certain of the practical aspects 
of photostat work. 

Both firms have two kinds of ap- 
paratus: a standard equipment, which 
leaves it to the operator to shift the 
prints to a rinsing tank and to dry them; 
and a "continuous photostat" or "super Rec- 
tigraph," which carries the prints auto— 
matically through the whole process from 
exposure to drying. The highest-priced 
continuous photostat costs $4000.00. The 
claim is made that it will turn out three 
prints a minute. The "super Rectigraph" 
costing #2600.00, is said to deliver prints 
completely fixed, washed, and dried at the 
rate of one a minute. 

The following are the principal 
differences between the two machines. The 
photostat carries the print on an endless 
chein through a developed bath, then 
through a chromium roller which squeezes 
out the surplus developer, into a rinsing 
tank of running water, and then face down 
into a shallow fixing tank which is con- 
tinuously agitated by a motor. The Recti- 
graph apparatus grasps the end of the pa- 
per and pushes it down into the developer,

many independent advantages. 


withdraws it up again by the same end, 
passes it through a roller (but not a bath 
of running water), covers its surface with 
the fixing solution, and lets it emerge 
face up in a deep fixing tank. All these 
features are interrelated. An advantage 
of the Rectigraph setup is that as each 
print is made, it can be examined immedi- 
ately to determine if it is satisfactory, 
thus eliminating considerable wastage. The 
Rectigraph uses a deeper tank because the 
solution is allowed to lie still; the photo- 
stat agitates the tank, which must there- 
fore be shallow. The Rectigraph claims 
that it can dispense with the agitating of 
the fixing bath because it covers the whole 
surface of the paper evenly with the solu- 
Soom berore it enters the bath. It is 
this covering of the surface prior to im- 
mersion in the bath which permits the print 
to appear face up in the tank. The photo- 
stat has a much heavier frame, which is 
necessary to resist the vibration caused 
by the agitating of the tank, but which has

Each company claims that it is 
more saving of chemicals. In the judgment 
of the writer, the photostat has the bet-— 
ter claim because the developer is washed 
off in running water before the print en- 


ters the fixing tank; although Rectigraph 


points out that their chemicals last longer 
because the tank does not expose as much 


Becurface to the air for deterioration. 


While it is true in general that 


the cost of photostat copies does not di- 
Meminish as the edition increases in size, 


) 


there is one significant exception. If 


the user demands a positive copy, the

LE 


distributed among then, 


photostat process must provide first a neg- 
ative and then make the positive from that. 
A positive copy therefore involves two 
steps and costs twice as much as a nega- 
tive. If a number of positive copies are 
required, the cost of the negative can be 
thus reducing the 





mecost of each. 

- On long jobs further economies in 
' the making of photostat positives can be 
, effected by reducing the original copy in 
' the negative and enlarging it back in the 
positive. The reduction to one-half size 
at the negative stage can result in two

kinds of economy. Only one-fourth as much 
paper is needed for the negative, and it is 
often possible when copying back to posi- 
tives to lay down four negatives at once, 
copy them all at one exposure, and thus 
save labor time. These possibilities do 
not materially reduce the cost level of 
photostat operations as compared with oth-— 
er processes. 

The most extreme use of the prin- 
ciple of making the negative small and en- 
larging it back in making the positive is 
the film-copying and enlarging process. If 
the negative copy is made with a very great 
reduction--say sixteen diameters-—-on film, 
it can be enlarged back on photostat paper 
with an ordinary film enlarger. This proc-— 
ess will yield positive copies on photostat 
paper for very little more (in some cases 
for less) than the cost of the negative 
photostat. The combination of film copy- 
ing with photostating is important because 
it redistributes the labor of making photo- 
graphic copies. One man can go off into 
the wilds with a small camera to make film 
copies, while leaving the work of enlarging 
to be done at another time and place. 

Although the apparatus has not yet 
been designed, it would be very easy to 
make a semi-automatic machine for enlarg- 
ing from film to paper. The only equipment 
to be added to the standard enlarger would 
be an automatic stepping device to move the 
film, one frame at a time, before the lens. 
Large-scale copying work from film to paper 
has already demonstrated that one worker 
ean do as many as 2000 sheets a day. With 
automatic apparatus this may be increased 
to 3000 pages. At such levels the costs of 
making positives on paper approach the ma— 
terials costs, for ten dollars worth of la- 
bor will use up fifty dollars worth of ma— 
terials. As will be pointed out in a later 
chapter, such cost situations introduce a 
temptation to reduce the size of the paper 
print to the lowest level of legibility. 

Another automatic device is oper- 
ated by the Recordak Corporation. This is 
a continuous process machine for transfer- 
IngeeerOll ot Lime coy anventarcederolli om 
paper. This service brings the price of 
the photostat copy to a point very near the 
price of the photostat paper. 

The whole field opened by film 
copying in reduced sizes will be discussed 
in a later chapter. For the present it is 


76 


sufficient to note that film copying and 
enlarging will yield positive copies on 
photostat paper for approximately the price 
of negative photostats. 


The Dexigraph 

Another type of photocopying equip— 
ment is the Dexigraph, (Figure XL), manu- 
factured by Remington Rand. It is a fixed 
focus camera, copying from a fixed size of 
ObFCbmoo a ened stiZeMoie copy Onc om 
its principal uses in scholarship is for 
the reproduction of library catalogue cards, 
although as with the other photostatic ap- 
paratus, it is also used for registrars! 
records, transcripts, etc. 

Miss Anna M. Monrad, Head Catalog — 
er of the Yale University Library, has 
written an article on the experience of 
Yale Library in using the Dexigraph to 
make an official catalogue.t Miss Monrad's 
article tells of experience with the auto- 
matic Dexigraph; Dr. Frederick Hicks, Law 
Librarian of Yale Law Library, in the ar- 
ticle, "Reproduction of Catalogue Cards by 
Photographic Methods ,"© gives an account 
of experimentation with the Junior Dexi- 
graph, using the machine as a substitute 
for the typewriter. Computations made for 
a six weeks! period indicated that dexi- 
graphing 5,417 cards, including material, 
labor, chemicals, machine rental, and 
wastage, cost $.03507 per card (5,211 usable 
ecards resulting); typing 5,211 cards cost 
$3033 per card. Dr. Hicks stated that 
even if the typing method were cheaper, 
the use of the Dexigraph would still be 
justified because of the factors of speed 
and accuracy. Other users include the

Dexigraph units are leased, not 
sold. The Junior Dexigraph, handling copy 
up to letter and legal size, is leased for 
from $10.00 to $25.00 per month. With

it. It can be leased for a one-year peri- 
od for $50.00 a month, but Remington Rand 
ordinarily uses it on a contract basis 
when a specific assignment for a job of 
some magnitude is required. 

Dexigraph copies, like photostat 
copies, are produced as negatives. Sensi- 
tized paper is used, and it comes in pre- 
cut or roll form. The price varies ac-— 
cording to weight, size, and type of paper. 
Standard Record paper ranges in price from 
$6.80 per 1,000 sheets 5" x 3", up to $32.00 
for 1,000 sheets 8" x 8"; Permanent Record 
paper begins at $8.80 per1,000 cards 5" x 
3" and goes up to $39.75 for the 8" x eft 
size; Duplex Permanent Record paper is more 
expensive. The roll paper is priced from 
$8.60 to $19.00, according to weight and 
size. Permanent Record paper is heavier 
than Standard Record paper and is sensitized 
on a paper stock resembling an all-rag 
stock. Dexigraph claims that the cost of 
labor, chemicals, material, etc., for cen— 
timeter cards should not exceed $.02 each 
where a quantity is involved; the legal 
size documents run about ¢.07 each. Both 
these figures include machine rental. 

Through the use of a color filter, 
colored paper can be copied. The turn of 
a dial varies the amount of light entering 
and consequently determines the amount of 
contrast desired. 

Tra W. Smith, in a report of April; 
1934, on methods of duplicating records, 
says that the University of California at 
Berkeley used the Dexigraph and made prints 
at a cost of approximately $#.03 each, in- 
cluding cost of paper, developing materials, 
and labor, when the volume of work was fair—- 
ly large. The cost when only a few prints 
were made at a time was about #.07 each. 


The Technological Frontier 

It is to be hoped that a means may 
be found to combine the economies due to 
saving of material in film copying with 
those due to labor saving in the Dexigraph. 
It should be possible to develop an auto-— 
matic machine for enlarging film copies to 
a fixed size. Such a device would bring 
photostat costs down very close to mere 
photostat paper costs. If such a device 
should then be developed to take full

advantage of the possibility of saving 
photographic surface by reducing the size 
of the reading matter, photostatic copies 
might enter a new cost level and hence ac- 
quire a new importance in the strategy of 
scholarship. The Joint Committee has 
heard that there is some prospect of de- 
velopment along this line. 

Typescript can serve as the master 
copy from which B-W and blueprints are 
made, provided it is written with a very 
black ribbon. It can serve as master copy 
for the photostat process without special 
preparation. To bring together all the 
processes for multiplying a typescript 
book, it is only necessary to imagine that 
BEE peScri pull lOO,000 words as Submitted 
Pomme clplicabion in the form om a“fair 
copy, 5564 pages, 8 1/2" x 11", 

How shall this be multiplied? It 
can be retyped for the format copy and re- 
produced by hectograph, mimeograph, or 
photo-offset. It can be photostated full 
size, half size, or in some intermediate 
size. If it happens to be typed in suffi- 
ciently dark print on the right kind of pa- 
per, it can be reproduced directly by any 
Gi the blueprint processes. If it is not 
suiticiently contrasved for the direct use 
ef a blueprint process, it can be photo- 
stated and blueprints made from the photo- 
stat negatives. Each of these processes 
will result in a legible product; the ex- 
Permit norenplal dn Mesiiilitm is ditricult 
to estimate. Each of them will exhibit its 
principal cost advantages at a particular 
Pert of the rising curve of edition size. 


Comparative Costs in Book Production 

It is now possible to compare costs 
of blueprint, photostat, and photo-offset 
in book production. 

The original to be reproduced may 
be either a printed book or a.pile of type- 
Benuipo. An octavo book of 100),000 words, 
6" x 9" page, with 400 words to the page 
would cover ninety-four square feet. A 
ipescripy Of normal format, S00 words to 
the page, would require 334 pages, 8 1/2" 
Pai", or 2Ly square feet. 

The alternatives that present them- 
selves in the reproduction of these texts 
are (a) typescript copying, (b) photostat, 
(c) blueprinting, and (d) photo-offset. 

Six of these processes (blueprint, 
blue line print, Van Dyke negative, Van 








te 


Dyke positive, B-W, and Ozalid) are incap- 
able of enlarging copy or reducing it, and 
equally incapable of dealing with such a 
thing as a book with pages printed on both 
sides. Those that involve the use of the 
photostat are adapted not only to the re- 
production of book pages, but also to the 
making of reductions. Since area is the 
governing factor alike in first and rum-— 
ning costs, the cost levels are highly sen-

Specu,  olLuc linemprinis or Van Dykesposi—

tions at costs just as elastic as those en-— 
countered in photo-offset and analyzed in 
ibe preceding chapter. That is to say, 2 
reduction of approximately 30% in the size 
of the page will reduce costs by 50%. The 
6" x 9" page would have to be reduced to 
something like 4" x 6"; the 8 1/2" x 11" 
page to something like 5 1/2" x 8 1/28", to 
effect this reduction in cost.

five copies, show themselves as the most 
sensitive. They are the meeting points of 
the different techniques. Carbon copying, 
Ozalid, and B-W copying come very close to- 
gether at the fifth copy; photo-offset, 
photostat, and Van Dyke positives meet each 
other close to the twenty-five mark. 

The key figures for the cost of 
reproduction (full size) are on page 79.

each other in the reproduction of the oc—

thirteen. 

Why is there this difference? 
Chiefly because the negatives in the dimen- 
sion 6" x 9" can be laid on the frame for 
photostating in a very economical way, and 
eight pages can be copied at a time.

The foregoing discussion has dealt 
with printed and typescript texts. It is 
important, however, to take into account 
the fact that all the blueprint, photo- 


offset, and photostat processes will re- 
produce charts, figures, and line drawings 
as easily as texts. This aspect of the 
problem of reproducing research materials 
will receive more complete analysis in the 
next chapter. 





CHAPTER VII 


BOOKS CONTAINING CHARACTERS NOT IN THE ROMAN ALPHABET, TABULAR 








MATTER, DIAGRAMS, AND ILLUSTRATIONS 


Classification of Special Problems 

Taevanaly sis OL Composition costs 
of printed and typescript books has been 
made on the assumption that the vehicle for 
the recording or communicating of thought 
was to be a text consisting of words writ-— 
ten in the Roman alphabet. Under those 
conditions, composition costs follow the 
number of words. Two thousand words cost 
twice as much as 1000 words. 

There are, however, a number of 
Verrenvor OL vis Situation, each of wiiceh 
affects the computation of costs in their 
relation to quality of product. These va-— 
riant ways of presenting thought can be 
classified as follows: 





I. Presentation of thought in words and 
numerals. 

A. Words in the Roman alphabet and 
numerals arranged as usual in hori- 
zontal lines, but with variations 
in size or body introduced for pur- 
poses of emphasis. -(Use- of ital— 
ics, bold-face, or smaller point 
size in footnote material.) 

Words in the Roman alphabet and 

numerals arranged in vertical as 

well as horizontal lines. (Tabular 
material of all kinds.) 

C. Words interspersed with characters 
not in the Roman alphabet, or num-— 
erals not arranged in simple hori- 
wombal lines: (Rexts that: include 
quoted Greek, treatises with in- 
tricate formulae.) 

Pictorial presentation of thought. 

A. Black and white drawings. (From 
the standpoint of reproduction 
technique, diagrams, graphs, maps, 
and pictures in black and white 
are the same.) 

B. Photographs or wash drawings. (The 
essential fact is that the repro- 
duction must distinguish diiferent 


Tile 


degrees of light and shade; in- 
stead of the sharp contrast of 
black and white, there are contin-— 
Udus variations in tone.) 

G. Collor reproduction. 


In every case where one of these 
vehicles for the presentation of thought 
is used in connection with a text, the ex— 
GEM Om dus Use may, em giclee tole sates 
there may be many footnotes or few, many 
or few Chinese characters may be inter- 
spersed, there may be only one or two tab— 
ulations in a whole book, or the book may 
consist almost entirely of tabular materi- 
als. The pictorial material may be a 
greater om Less proportion @m the whole 
content of the book, it may be in the form 
of larger or smaller areas, large maps and 
charts, page-size photographs, or small

In respect of all these variants of 
the "normal" Look, the same fundamental 
distinctions hold between large and small 
editions, between running costs of process— 
es like relief printing, which reduce the

tion increases, and of processes like the 
photostat, which have constant costs per 
Copy regardless ol Vsize Of ‘edition.  Watin 
costs, there are also correlated different 
degrees of legibility in the case of words 
and numerals, and different degrees of 
fidelity of reproduction in the case of 
pictorial matter. There are variations in 
beauty im the final product that follow 
from the adoption of one or another tech- 
nique, or the assumption of one or another 
cost. There is a cost differential between 
the reproductions of text and picture that 
are sufficiently legible and faithful for 
the accurate transmission of thought, and 
reproductions which go beyond this neces-— 
sity in order to give aesthetic pleasure 
to the reader.

METHODS OF REPRODUCING RESEARCH MATERIALS 





The processes already described—— 
relief printing, photo-offset, typescript, 
hectograph, mimeograph, manuscript with 
photo--offset, blueprinting and photostat— 
ing--all reappear in various combinations 
in the multiplying of materials of these 
various kinds. Descriptions and cost anal- 
yses of these processes contained in the 
preceding chapters can be applied to the 
problem presented here. 


Reproduction in Typescript, Manuscript, 


and Relief Printing without Pictorial Mat—- 
ter 


When a text consists of words in 
the Roman alphabet, arranged in horizontal 
lines, but with variations in size or body, 
the ordinary typewriter begins to lose ef- 
ficiency in comparison with the linotype 
or monotype on the one hand and the Vari- 
typer on the other. The standard typewrit-— 
er can introduce only three variations in- 
to the form of a text: it can underline 
words or sentences, change the interlinear 
spacing, and change the length of line. 
These variations are usually introduced in 
typescript to set off quoted matter from 
non-quoted matter. They do not always ma- 
terially increase typescript composition 
costs, and they affect multiplying costs 
of typescript books only in so far as these 
interfere with the use of non-standard in- 
terlinear spacing. If the spacing of four 
and one-half or five lines to the inch is 
used with pica typescript, the quoted mat— 
ter cannot be set off from the regular 
text by reducing the interlinear spacing. 
If footnotes are to be introduced, the com— 
position cost is increased by the need for 
careful calculation to distribute the page 
correctly between the text and footnote. 

The disadvantage of the standard 
typewriter in the preparation of typescript 
material with footnotes for photo-offset 
reproduction can be met to some extent by 
the use of paste pot and shears in the mak— 
ing of the format copy. The footnotes can 
be typed separately with an elite or micro- 
elite machine, and pasted on the bottom of 
the page of text. 

The Varityper will allow the in- 
troduction of a greater number of varie-— 
ties of typescript faces and the text and 
interlinear spacings. The linotype or 
monotype is still more elastic in this re- 
spect. 


Composition costs will sometimes 
increase with the introduction of these va- 
riants. To give a quantitative comparison 
of the increase in cost is not practical. 
The differences do not seem to be great 
enough to have decisive influence on the 
choice of techniques, unless (in the case 
of typescript composition) the need for the 
Varityper machine should make it impracti- 
cal to calculate typescript composition 
costs on any basis save that of the prices 
of format copying offered by photo-offset 
companies. In a particular case these 
shop prices may be so much higher than the 
office costs of standard typescript compo- 
sition that the change from typescript to 
relief printing would be indicated. 

In the preparation of tabular mat-— 
ter, the linotype or monotype exhibits ad- 
vantages because it facilitates the center- 
ing of text on a page and of the headings 
of columns. The typewriter stands at a 
disadvantage in the preparation of tabular 
material because of the lack of elasticity 
in the size of letters in the headings of 
columns. The mimeoform process is not well 
adapted to the production of tabular mate- 
rial because it does not easily reproduce 
vertical lines. The typewriter also shows 
its limitations when vertical lines on a 
page are desired. 

If tabular material is to be given 
its maximum beauty and clarity, it may call 
for manuscript composition. The kind of 
skill in lettering and numbering that is 
used in the manuscript composition of tab- 
ular material is widely available, since it 
is developed by the engineering profession 


and taught in vocational schools as "mechan- 


ical drawing." The three techniques avail-— 
able for the reproduction of tabular mate— 
rial are, then, relief printing, typescript 
with or without photographic multiplying, 
and manuscript with some photographic tech—- 
niques of multiplying (blueprinting, photo- 
stating, photo-offset, ete.) 

Cost comparisons are difficult to 
establish among the three kinds of composi- 
tion of tabular matter. In linotyping, the 
extra charge for tabular matter may run 
from 75% to 600%; in typescript, from 25% 
to 200%; and the cost of manuscript prepar- 
ation of tables can be guessed from the 
fact that draughtsmen are available at wag- 
es of #.60 per hour for ordinary skill and 
$1.00 per hour for high skill, and that

CHARACTERS NOT IN ROMAN ALPHABET, TABULAR MATTER, DIAGRAMS, ILLUSTRATIONS 


their speed is much less than that of a 
ayia Site 

When words are interspersed with 
characters not in the Roman alphabet, the 
non—Roman characters may happen to be in 
another alphabet (i.e., Greek or Russian) 
that is available as a special matrix for 
the linotype, or as a special type font, or 
a special type plate for the Varityper. A 
font of type sufficient for occasional Rus— 
sian words in a book costs $30.00 or $40.00; 
a Varityper type plate costs $5.00 in ba- 
kelite and $8.50 in metal; a font of Chi- 
nese type varies in cost according to com— 
pleteness. There could be no linotype 
matrix or Varityper type plate for Chinese 
on account of the number of the symbols. 

The only alternative to the use of 
the special matrix, type font, or type 
plate is the use of manuscript. The text, 
as typed or printed in Roman characters, 
can be interspersed with the Chinese or 
other characters by hand. If the whole 
book is to be printed by relief printing, 
these hand-drawn symbols can be made into 
small line cuts, exactly as if they were 
drawings, and filled into the spaces left 
in the linotype or monotype composition; if 
the book is to be reproduced by a photo- 
graphic technique, they can be drawn in 
place upon the typescript or printed for- 
mat copy, after which no special costs 
will arise. 

In the case of a Bibliography on 
Northeastern Asia, compiled by Professor 
Kerner of the University of California, 
there were 15,500 items, of which 5,000 ti- 
tles were in the western language; 3,500 in 
Russian; 2,500 in Chinese; and 2,500 in 
Japanese. Letterpress reproduction was out 
of the question because of the high costs 
involved in connection with the foreign 
languages and the small-edition size; 
photo-offset was the ideal process for the 
job. The method proposed in the making of 
the master copy was to have the English 
typed in first, space being gauged and al- 
lowed for the other titles. The Russian 
was then to be typed in with a Hammond 
typewriter; these pages in turn were to be 
given over to a student who would write in 
the Chinese and Japanese characters by 
hand, in a size proportionate to the typ-— 
ing. The pages would then be ready to 


85 


serve as the master copy for the photo- 
offset work. Estimates for the composition 
cost of the master copy ranged from $1,200 
to $3,000. 

The need for special equipment and 
special skill in the reproduction of mate- 
rials with non-Roman alphabet content lim- 
its the competition for the work to certain 
specially favored plants. The author him- 
self may be in a position to assume some of 
the composition costs by filling in the 
non-Roman symbols in spaces left for the 
purpose in the typescript or printed com- 
position. This shifting of composition 
cost toward the author is a normal possi- 
bility in the production of typescript 
books; it becomes especially important if 
the preparation of the format copy requires 
a rare skill or knowledge that the author 
happens to command, either in himself or 
in his assistants. 


Techniques in the Reproduction of Pictorial 


Matter 

There are six fundamental tech- 
niques for the reproduction of pictorial 
matter. All of them involve the use of 
photography and hence permit enlargements 
or reductions from the original picture. 
The costs of all of them are fundamentally 
area costs and running costs, for one can 
hardly speak of a composition cost factor 
in the reproduction of pictures. Most of 
them have already been described and anal- 
yzed in connection with the reproduction 
of texts. They must here be given further 
description and classification. 

The six fundamental techniques are 
the following: 


1. Relief processes. These come up from 
the original wood-block technique. Ink 
is carried to paper on the raised part 
of the printing surface. The standard 
forms in which this technique appears 
in small edition book publishing are 
the zine cut and the zinc or copper 
photoengraving. 

&amp;. Planographic processes. These are re—- 
lated to the original lithography. A 
plane surface differentially receptive 
to ink receives the ink from a roller 
and transfers it to the paper. Photo- 
offset is the standard form. 


1. Note that in this case a single copy of the book would be printed as page proof, filled in by hand, 


and then multiplied by photo-offset. 


84 METHODS OF REPRODUCING RESEARCH MATERIALS 





5. Intaglio processes. These are variants 
of etching. Ink is carried to paper in 


the sunken parts of a metal surface. 

4. Photogelatin or collotype. This proc-— 
ess bears some resemblance to plano- 
graphic processes because the printing 
surface is differentially receptive to 
ink and moisture, some resemblance to 
intaglio because there are actually 
raised parts of the surface that reject 
ink and depressed parts that receive it. 

5. Photosensitive paper processes. These 
are blueprinting, photostating, and 
photography. In these processes there 
is no use of ink. The paper used, for 
multiplying the pictorial matter is 
covered over its entire area with a 
photosensitive surface and then sub ject— 
ed to the action of light and to chem-— 
ical action that transfers the image to 
aimee 

6. Projection image processes. These 
respond to microcopying. They are 
same as those using photosensitive 
except that the image is developed on a 
transparent medium (glass or film) in a 
reduced size and then rendered useful 
by projection on a screen.

because they lack importance, but rather 
because their complexity makes analysis of 
costs and results) ditiiculy, and thei: 
place in the reproduction of materials of 
scholarship is subordinate to that of the 
monochromatic processes. 

In all of these processes there 
are different degrees of fidelity in re- 
production of pictorial matter. These dif- 
ferences are of two kinds: differences in 
fineness of detail and differences in fine- 
HESSmOnmmacCCuracy Ol stone’. 

4 The fineness of detail is primar— 
Diveaecesultanu om size. eAnword sinaie pace 
ture multiplied in a copy 6" x 9" will 
show more detail than the same picture 
Multiplied! in a. copy 3" x 41/2". But the 
method of reproduction has something to do 
with it. The 3" x 41/2" copy made by the 
photosensitive paper process on a good bro- 
mide paper might show more detail than the 
6" x 9" copy made on photostat paper; the 
smaller copy carefully photoengraved with 
a high screening would show more detail 





than the larger copy done with a low 


sereening. These terms will be explained 
below; the essential fact to be established 
at this point is the quality of fineness of 
detail as an element in the reproduction of 
pictorial matter. 

The variations in accuracy or fine- 
ness of tone are evident in the first in- 
stance in the contrast between a pen and 
ink drawing and a photograph. The pen and 
ink drawing has but two tones—-black and 
white; the photograph has a number of in- 
termediate tones. Some processes of re- 
production (such as telephoto on newsprint 
paper) will render with recognizable dis-— 
tinctness only three or four tones; pho- 
tography on a soft bromide paper will ren- 
der so many different tones that the meas-— 
ure of them is given not by the actual sur- 
face of the picture, but by the sensitiv— 
ity of the human eye to distinctions in 
I chitin ens ti cyse 

Moreover, some processes will show 
the maximum number of distinctions in tone 
in the lighter greys and will cause all the 
darker areas of the picture to take on a 
flat black. This is especially true of the 
photogelatin process. Others will bring 
out very clearly the different tones in the 
darker areas but show few differences of 
shading in the lighter parts. The success 
of a particular process in separating the 
tones of a picture carries with it success 
in exhibiting some kinds of detail. 

Another distinction to be made be- 
tween these processes is their different 
degrees of adaptability in the combining of 
pictorial and textual matter. The relief 
pictorial processes combine with relief 
printing in the production of books, the 
planographic processes with photo-offset 
printing. Intaglio and photogelatin proc-— 
esses are used for the production of pic-— 
torial matter separate from text but are 
capable of being combined with text in a 
bound form. There seems to be no good 
technical reason for not combining photo-— 
gelatin pictorial work with reproduction of 
text by photogelatin, though the combina-— 
tion has not actually entered trade prac— 
tice. Pictures made on photosensitive pa- 
per can also be bound into books. Only 
pictures made on transparent media for pro- 
jection are absolutely incapable of combi- 
navion wlth Gext ins bookperorm ss Anymore 
of these processes can be used to reproduce 





pictorial matter in a form or size that 
will not be bound with the text in a book 
but will go to the reader of the book as a 
separate item. 


Photoengraving and Photo-Offset 
The fundamental elements of the 


photo-offset process have been explained 
in the chapter on the reproduction of out-— 
of-—print books and have received further 
reference in the chapter on the photo- 
offset reproduction of typescript books. 

The first part of the photo-offset 
process is the fundamental one in the re- 
production of pictorial matter in large 
editions, because it appears not only in 
the production of books by photo-offset, 
but also as an intermediate stage in the 
preparation of line cuts and photoengrav— 
ineseior relief printing’. 

The first stage in this process is 
the making of a photographic negative. 
While photolithographers have developed 
the use of film and paper negatives, photo-— 
engravers have remained loyal to the wet 
plate process for making negatives. There 
Homomvechnological reason for this; it is 
the result rather of the traditions of the 
craft. 

The photographic negative is then 
transferred to a sensitized metal surface. 
The image is burned on to a zinc sheet 
that has been coated with albumen and am-— 
monium bichromate, the unfixed emulsion is 
washed off, and the zine surface is inked. 
Up to this point the photo-offset process 
and photoengraving process are the same. 
So far as the chemical quality of the met- 
al surface is concerned, it would be ready 
to be clipped on to.a photo-offset press. 
But an additional stage is necessary if 
the metal is to be prepared for relief 
printing. 

The additional step, required for 
the sake of using the relief printing prin- 
ciple, is an application of an acid etch 
to the prepared zinc sheet. The inked 
plate is dusted with powdered resin or 
"dragon's blood," which adheres to the ink 
and falls off the clean metal. The drag- 
‘on's blood is melted into place by warming 

the zine. This will protect the printing 
surface from acid. Then the zinc is bathed 
in acid. Repeated baths of acid and coat-— 
‘ings of dragon's blood cut away the ex— 
posed parts of the plate and leave the pro-

tected parts as a raised printing surface. 
When the printing surface is prepared in 
this way, it is tacked on a wooden block 
and is then ready to be fitted in with 
linotype slugs or monotype composition in 
a flat-—bed press. 

Of course the two processes are not 
in practice as interchangeable as this de- 
scription might make it appear. The photo- 
offset worker uses a special thin metal 
sheet, which may be aluminum rather than 
zinc; the photoengraver uses a heavier 
sheet of metal which he will cut up into 
blocks. He may use copper or nickel in- 
stead of zinc. The traditions of the two 
crafts are very different, but the chemis— 
try of the process is the same, save that 
the photoengraver must carry out an addi- 
tional step, namely, the acid etch. 

In the photo-offset process this 
preparation of the printing surface is 
identical for text and for black-and-white 
pictorial matter. In the relief printing 
process the preparation of the printing 
surface for the text by linotype is quite 
different from the preparation of the pic-— 
torial printing surface or line cut. There- 
fore, in relief printing, an additional 
cost: factor must be taken into account—— 
the fitting together of pictorial and tex- 
tual printing surfaces. This cost factor 
is absent from the photo-offset process. 


Half-—tone Pictures in Photo-Offset and 
Photoengraving 

Photo-offset and photoengraving 
present the same similarities as and dif- 
ferences from other processes when pictori- 
al matter to be reproduced is not a black- 
and—white image, but a half—tone picture 
showing different shades of grey. To print, 
whether by photo-offset or relief technique, 
a picture that will show different shades 
of grey requires resort to an optical il- 
dS. 

If a number of small dots on a 
white ground are seen from a reading dis-— 
tance they will appear to run together as 
grey. The grey will be lighter or darker 
according to the density of the dots—-that 
is to say, according to the proportion of 
the paper surface they occupy. The tone 
will seem smooth or rough according to the 
size of the dots. The photoengraver or 
photo-offset printer, when he reproduces a 
photograph, renders the greys intermediate 


86 





between black and white by printing aggre- 
gations of dots. The newspaper reproduc-— 
tions of photographs are so coarse that 
they can be analyzed by the naked eye into 
their constituent arrays of dots; there 
are small black dots in the lighter greys, 
larger ones in the darker greys, while in 
the darkest greys the black dots rum to- 
gether, leaving small white dots between 
them. 

To break the continuous tones of 
an original photograph into a printing sur- 
face that will, by putting dots on paper, 
give an illusion of a comparable range of 
tone, the photoengraver or photolithograph- 
er prepares his negative in a special way. 
He uses a "screen." The screen is a com-— 
bination of two sheets of glass, ruled di- 
agonally with opaque lines crossing at 
right angles, and cemented and bound to- 
gether. When the light passes through such 

“a screen, it reaches the plate in dots and 
so causes the image on the negative to ap- 
pear in dots also. Four main factors de— 
termine these dot formations: the amount 
of light reflected by the copy (i.e., the 
light and shade tones of the photograph 
that is being copied), the size of the open- 
ings used in the camera, the distance of 
the screen from the photographic plate, 
and the fineness of the screen. The fine- 
ness of the screen is expressed in lines 
to the inch and varies from 45 to 400. 

The screening of the photograph is 
a stage in the preparation of the negative, 
whether wet plate, film, or paper. When 
the screened negative has been prepared, 
the further steps in the process, whether 
for photo-offset or relief printing, are 
identical with the steps that must be tak- 
en in the case of black-and-white drawings. 

There has been devised a special 
kind of screen made up of very small lens 
formations stamped in a sheet of heavy 
transparent cellulosic film.) it wis said 
that this screen simplifies the work of 
making screened negatives and may there- 
fore reduce the skilled labor element in 
the cost of making screened photographs. 

Half—tones screened up to 100 to 
the inch are made on zinc, above that they 
are usually made on copper, and very fine 
screening is done on nickel. The photo- 
offset press can reproduce half-tones 
screened as fine as 175, but generally us- 
es screens from 120-150 lines to the inch. 





METHODS OF REPRODUCING RESEARCH MATERIALS 


The ordinary photographic work seen in the 
advertising pages of magazines is screened 
120-155 lines to the inch; newspaper 
photographs are screened 45 to 65 lines; 
the aquatone process, a variant of photo- 
offset, uses screens up to 400 lines to the 
fa char 

In general, the finer the screen 
the more faithful will be the reproduction 
of detail. The reader who would appraise 
the effect of refinement in screening upon 
rendition of detail and richness of tone is 
referred to the exhibits bound herewith. 
(Figures XLVI-XLIX.) The photographic work 
on the finer screens is no more costly than 
on the coarse screens, but the printing is 
more difficult. The finer the screen the 
more careful the presswork must be, and the 
smoother the finish of the paper upon which 
it is to be printed. The photo-offset- 
press does not require the delicate make- 
ready necessary with highly screened plates 
on a flat-—bed press, but the tones rendered 
by the offset method often appear flat in 
contrast with the products of photoengrav— 
ing. 


The Large and Small Offset Presses in Pic- 
torial Work 


TneChap rerwkiisymro nee pin Tiulnieamons 
books, it was stated that there are two 
kinds of photo-offset presses: the large 
press, such as the Harris press, used by 


printers for commercial work; and the small- 


er presses, such as the rotaprint and mul- 
tilith, used also as office equipment by 
non-professional operators. In Chapter V, 
on the typescript book, there was included 
a discussion of plate size in connection 
with format, and of the use of direct typ- 
ing on the metal sheet of the smaller 
photo-offset presses. 

In this chapter, where illustrative 
material is under discussion, it becomes 
necessary to compare the efficiency of the 
large and small presses in respect of fine- 
ness of work. Needless to say, the quality 
of a press is reflected in its work in the 
reproduction of books out of print and in 
the reproduction of typescript books; but 
the presswork becomes most important when 
screened photographs are to be reproduced, 
for differences in quality of presswork 
manifest themselves most clearly in the re- 
production of half—tones.

manufacturers of these presses make various 
claims as to the quality of their products. 
To lay the matter objectively before the 
reader, the Joint Committee has taken two 
photographs—-an archeological picture and 

a manuscript——-and had them both screened at 
B80, 155, 150, and 175 lines to the inch. 
“This negative, with its four different 
screenings, was then run on the rotaprint 
(Figure XLII), the multilith (Figure XLIII), 
and the Harris press (Figure XLI). The 
differences between fineness of screening 
can be noted by comparing, on the same 
page, the first and last reproductions; the 
differences in presswork, and presumably 
‘in efficiency of the press, are detected 
by comparing a reproduction in one screen- 
ing on one press with the reproduction in 

_ the Same screening on another press. 


; 
_Photogelatin or Collotype 
j In the reproduction of half-—tone 


q 
‘pictures, there is an alternative to the 
use of the optical illusion produced by 
_the arrangement of dots on a white back- 
ground. The ink itself may be laid on the 
paper in a surface of varying depth. Any- 
one who examines a badly printed page of 
type may observe that some of the letters 
are lighter than others because the print-— 
er has not given the paper an even pres— 
“sure on the type metal surfaces; some let-— 
‘ters are therefore printed in a lighter 
mone than others. This same principle of 
warying the amount of ink that is laid on 
-a paper surface will reproduce half—tones. 
The two techniques that utilize this prin- 
‘Ciple are photogelatin (sometimes called 
-collotype) and photogravure. 

In photogelatin printing, as in 
dermaprint, the chemical basis of the proc- 
ess is the action of gelatin and a bichro- 
mate under the influence of light. A plate 
of glass or metal that has been ground to 
give it a tooth is covered with gelatin 
that has been made light-sensitive by being 
treated with ammonium bichromate, and is 
rapidly dried with heat. The rapid drying 
Sileaves the gelatin in a state of strain. 
It is ready, on the slightest provocation, 

to crackle like the paint on a badly 
painted surface. This crackling is called 
"reticulation." At this point photography 
intervenes.

printing frame through a photographic nega-— 
tive. The transparent parts of the nega-— 
tive (i.e., the ones which will print black 
in the finished copy) allow the light to 
tan the bichromated gelatin; the dark parts 
of the negative leave the gelatin untanned. 
When the plate is then developed in water, 
the gelatin crackles or reticulates, be- 
cause the tanned gelatin on top resists the 
expansion of the soft gelatin below. This 
cracked surface has a crepelike formation 
with more reticulation in the high lights 
and less in the shadows. This grain in 
photogelatin is much finer than the grain 
of a highly screened photoengraving. More— 
over, the photogelatin plate does not ex— 
hibit, like the photolithographic plate, a 
sharp distinction between the parts that 
will take ink and those that will not. The 
amount of the tanning effect upon the gel- 
atin and the degree of reticulation show 
continuous gradations from those parts of 
the plate that have received most light to 
those that have received least. 

When the photogelatin plate has 
been exposed and developed, it is moistened 
with a mixture of glycerine and water be- 
fore being inked. The glycerine—water mix- 
ture does two things: first, it swells the 
untanned parts of the gelatin surface so 
that they rise slightly higher than the 
tanned and reticulated parts. This permits 
the ink to lie more heavily in the parts of 
the plate that have received most light 
during exposure under the photographic neg— 
ative. Because of this slight difference 
in height of printing surface, the process 
is sometimes called an intaglio process. 

The second thing done by the gly— 
cerine—water mixture is more in line with 
photolithographic principles. Since the 
raw glycerine absorbs more moisture than 
the tanned gelatin, it is less receptive 
to ink. The soft gelatin acts like the 
moistened metal surface of the photolitho- 
graphic plate, taking water and rejecting 
ink. The supply of moisture on the gelatin 
is not replenished from any water roller, 
but from the air. The glycerine picks up 
the moisture from the air. 

The photogelatin plate will not 
make as many impressions as the photolith— 
ographic plate. When the gelatin is laid 
on glass, it lasts for about 5000 impres- 
sions; when laid on aluminum, for 5000 to 
10,000 impressions. Because of the short 


88 


life of the plate, the photogelatin proc-— 
ess is not suited to long runs. 

In the photogelatin technique, 
photographs are reproduced without screen-— 
INGR ee LaS hack mayne PeSulL gaan LoWwemmcosius 
than would appear in photoengraving or even 
in photo-offset of screened photographs. 

Another peculiarity of the photo-— 
gelatin technique is the ability to repro- 
duce pictures printed as photoengravings. 
It is very difficult to make a new screened 
photoengraving from a published half-—tone, 
because the light from the aggregation of 
dots in the half—tone does not behave in 
the screening like light from an original 
photograph or wash drawing. If an author 
wishes to use from a published book a 
photoengraved illustration, he can secure 
a much more accurate copy with the photo- 
gelatin technique than with the photoen- 
graving or photo-offset technique. In a 
series of history books, The Rise of Modern 
Europe, the firm of Harper Brothers used 
photogelatin for the reproduction of illus- 
trations. The use of this process has made 
it much easier than it would otherwise be 
to gather the illustrative material, be- 
cause pictures could be copied without go- 
ing back to the photographs from which the 
photoengraved prints were made. 

The presses used in the photogela— 
tin process are of two types: the rotary 
presses, taking large flexible metal sheets 
(usually aluminum); and the flat-bed press- 
es, which use a thick sheet of glass. The 
dimensions of these presses vary. The Con- 
tinental Lithograph Corporation of Cleve- 
land has rotary presses 44" x 64"; the 
Meriden Gravure Company of Meriden, Con- 
necticut, uses a flat—bed press 28" x $9". 

The principle explained in connec-— 
tion with the photo-offset process, that 
that format is least costly which uses the 
largest proportion of the available print- 
ing surface area with least wastage, ap- 
plies equally to photogelatin. 

The photogelatin process, primarily 
used for illustrations either in book pub- 
lications or in posters, could be adapted 
to the reproduction of textual matter. 
There is no technological obstacle to the 
preparation of copy for the photogelatin 
process in the form of typescript text and 
unscreened photographic prints or negatives. 
Two full—tone collotype reproductions are 
shown herewith (Figure XLIV, XLV). Note

The limitation imposed upon 
process by the rapid wearing out of 
printing surface has influenced the 
the process commercially. But this 
tion is more like an advantage when the 
process is considered in connection with 
the reproduction of research materials, for 
the accountancy and trade practices of the 
photogelatin shop have adapted themselves 
to the short runs that are common to all 
research publications.

Intaglio Processes: Photogravure 

All intaglio printing processes use 
a metal plate in which shallow depressions 
receive ink, which is then transmitted to 
paper, making a darker tone where the de- 
pression is deepest, and a lighter tone 
where the depression is slight. 

The photogravure process is a 
photochemical intaglio technique. A smooth 
sheet of copper is first given a very fine 
dusting with powdered asphaltum or resin. 
When this fine dust is baked on to the 
plate it furnishes a protective grain, com— 
parable to the grain that appears in the 
photogelatin process when the gelatin 
reticulates under the influence of the 
He Gre 

Then a film of bichromated gelatin 
is laid on the copper plate and printed on 
the same principle as that which is used 
in the photogelatin process, except that 
in this case it is printed from a positive 
photograph instead of a negative. The 
light therefore hardens the gelatin in 
those parts of the picture that are to be 
light, and leaves it soft in those parts 
of the picture that are to be dark. The 
copper plate is then put into an acid bath, 
which quickly eats away the soft gelatin 
and gets to work on the copper; but its ac-— 
tion on the copper is slower to the degree 
that the hardening of the gelatin (as an 
effect of light) has slowed it down. Thus 
the copper plate will emerge from the proc— 
ess with depressions that are deepest in 
those areas which correspond to the dark 
places in the positive photograph and 
slightest in the places that correspond to 
the light places in the original photo- 
graph.

One of the advantages of the photo- 
gravure method over others is the ease 
with which the plate can be retouched by 
The shadows can be darkened, for 
instance, by deepening the depressions in 
the copper. 


Aquatone and Pantone 
Two variants of the photo-offset 


process should be mentioned at this time. 
One of them is the aquatone process, a 
planographic process that produces remark— 
ably faithful reproductions of photographs 
from a gelatin plate. It is not a widely 
used process, Edward Stern and Company, 
Inc., of Philadelphia being the only es- 
tablishment the author knows of that does 
this kind of work,* but it makes very fine 
reproductions. It has many similarities 
to the photogelatin method. An example of 
aquatone work is displayed herewith (Fig- 
ure L). 





The aquatone plate is made of a 
thin sheet of zinc. Edward Stern and Com-— 


_ pany, Inc., uses a 45" x 54" plate for its 


presses. To furnish a base for the gela- 
tin coating, the zine sheet is "grained! 
with quartz; the gelatin is then applied, 
set, and washed in a hardening solution. 
For further hardening, the plate is baked 
to 200° F. A bichromate sensitizer is 
used to make the gelatin light sensitive, 
and then the plate is put in a printing 
frame in contact with the illustration it 


mis desired to reproduce.

run. 


The illustration to be reproduced, 
which has been stripped onto a sheet of 
glass, is pressed into close contact with 
the plate, and the printing is accomplished 
by exposure of the sensitive plate to a 
strong arc lamp. The light makes the sen- 
sitized gelatin which has been exposed be- 


| come impervious to water and alcohol. When 


the printing stage is passed, water and 
alcohol are used to develop the plate; 
this water and alcohol solution removes 
the unaffected bichromate and leaves a 
positive image. A second baking toughens 
the gelatin and gives it a longer life on

tions, and precision are essential for good 
results. 

The plate is fastened to a cylinder 
and fed water during each revolution by a 
water roller. The average plate runs about 
£0,000 impressions, but a run of 30,000 or 
more is quite possible. Only the gelatin 
that has not been affected by the light 
will absorb the water; therefore, when the 
ink rollers come into contact with the cyl- 
inder, the ink is repelled by the dampened 
gelatin and attracted by the dry positive 
image. The rubber blanket cylinder, receiv— 
ing the ink that has been deposited on the 
plate, comes in turn in contact with the 
impression cylinder and brings the paper 
into position for receiving the ink impres-— 
sion. 

Offset paper with a very hard 
rough surface is best suited for aquatone 
work. 

The cost of aquatone work compares 
with that of fine offset work. 

The second variant is the pantone 
or mercury process. Pantone is a compli- 
cated process designed to make use of a 
principle similar to that of photolithog-— 
raphy to prepare a printing surface which 
will stand long rums and be very resistant 
to wear. It makes use of the fact that 
chromium is a hard metal which will accept 
and transfer ink, while mercury will re- 
fuse ink. The chromium serves instead of 
the grease of primitive lithography; the 
mercury takes the place of water on the 
wet surface of the stone. 

Although this process is not use— 
ful in cheapening small editions, it is 
interesting as an illustration of the va- 
riety of techniques which can be used in 
printing. A sheet of iron is coated with 
a thin surface of copper and a very thin 
surface of chromium on top of the copper, 
and then a photographic emulsion on top of 
the chromium. The text is transferred to 
the plate in the usual photolithographic 
method, and the parts of the metal which 
ordinarily receive water are etched with 
acid through the chromium to the copper. 
Silver is then deposited on the plate and 
adheres to the copper but avoids the chrom- 
ium. The mercury is rubbed over the plate, 
and the mercury amalgamates with the silver. 


2. Edward Stern and Company, Inc., has made available an excellent booklet, "What Is Aquatone?" which 


gives a detailed description of the process.

METHODS OF REPRODUCING RESEARCH MATERIALS 


The result is an all-metal plate which will] a picture of this size can be used in an 


print without using the raised-type princi- 
ple. Related processes are the Renck and 
Porte methods. 

Some efforts have been made to use 
the mercury process for combining the 
photolithographic principle with the me— 
chanics of the flat-—bed press. The proc-— 
ess is also used with the offset press. It 
has no immediate practical importance in 
connection with the problems of reproduc— 
ing research materials. 


Dermaprint 

The dermaprint stencil method has 
been described in connection with the re- 
production of out-of-print books. It is 
the coarsest of the multiplying techniques 
that utilize the photographic principle. 
The dermaprint stencil will reproduce 
line drawings, but in the reproduction of 
screened pictures it will take only the 
coarsest screens. Dermaprint screening is 
not even as fine as the segreening used in 
newspaper work. 


Photosensitive Paper Processes 
Illustrations can be copied by the 
various blueprinting techniques, by photo- 
stat, and by photographic printing on bro- 
mide paper. The differences in quality are 
not unlike those differences that appear 
in the other techniques: they are differ- 
ences in the accuracy in the rendition of 
detail, and differences in faithfulness in 
the reproduction of tones. The so-called 
"soft" bromide papers give the widest 
range of tones; hard bromide papers and 
photostat papers offer a much reduced range, 
and the blueprint types of paper offer even 
less tone variety. The variation in ac— 
curacy in the rendering of detail is the 
same: the bromide prints are most accu— 
rate and the blueprints least accurate. 
The costs naturally are in reverse order. 
In making cost comparisons, two 
types of material should be distinguished: 
those requiring only black-and-white con- 
trast and those requiring half-tones. 


Cost Comparisons

sons must be a picture of a given area re=

dimensions of the picture chosen for this 
first comparative table are 4" x 6" because

sumed, moreover, that 100 illustrations of 
identical size are required. The book here 
described is, therefore, a book of 100 pag-— 
es of pictorial material, consisting of 6" 
x 9" pages with pictorial matter 4" x 6" on 
each page. 

This crude comparison indicates 
that in size of edition the processes that 
operate by diminishing costs (photo-offset, 
photoengraving, photogelatin, photogravure) 
begin to become cheaper than the processes 
involving more constant costs (blueprint, 
photostat, bromide photographs) when the 
edition is between 50 and 100 copies. But 
there are a number of other variables to be 
considered. These variables relate both to 
cost conditions and quality conditions. 

One variation in cost conditions 
has to do with the number of different pic-— 
tures reproduced. If the specifications 
called for the reproduction of only one or 
five or twelve pictures instead of a hun- 
dred, would there be a substantial modifi- 
cation of the cost relationships that ap- 
pear on the foregoing table? If the pic-— 
torial matter were in larger pictorial -sur- 
faces or smaller pictorial surfaces, would 
the processes still stand in the same cost 
order? 

The information needed to answer 
these questions accurately is not at hand. 
There are, however, certain concrete quota- 
tions which can be set down and then com-— 
pared in so far as they are comparable. All 
the diminishing cost techniques are repre-— 
sented, for quotations have been given by 
a firm specializing in photogravure and a 
firm specializing in photogelatin, and 
photoengraving prices are highly stand— 
ardized. These quotations are taken to 
cover different sizes of picture and dif- 
ferent sizes of page, according to the 
table on page 92. 


Combination of Pictorial and Textual Mat-— 
ter 

The full complexity of the cost 
analysis of the reproduction of pictorial 
matter does not appear until allowance is 
made for the different ways in which pic— 
tures may be combined with text. 

The simplest situation is that of 
the photo-offset book illustrated with 
black-and-white drawings, charts, or maps.

Here the pictorial material is simply com-— 
bined with the format copy, and no fur- 
ther effect upon cost is felt. 

Whenever pictorial material is to 
be combined with relief printing, the cost 
of fitting the type around the photoen- 
-graved blocks must be met. 

When half—tone work is combined 
with text in photo-offset the cost of the 
screening must be added to the normal. cost 
of photo-offset book production.

ing his book, he will simply gather the 
illustrative sheets with the typescript 
pages and have them bound in place. 

If the edition is larger, he may 
wish to take advantage of the law of dimin- 
ishing costs in larger editions and to set 
up his book for reproduction by printing, 
photo-offset, or photogelatin. He will 
then wish to decide whether the illustra- 
tive material should be fitted in with the 
text or reproduced as separate pages. The 
variables are so numerous that it will not 
be possible to set forth here the definite 
costs that may be involved in any decision. 

The most important distinction 
must be made between the drawings, which 
are to be done in black and white, and the 
tone pictures, which must be reproduced to 
show the intermediate tones. The next 
most important decision lies between pub-— 
lication of illustrations on separate pag- 
es or on the same pages with the text.

For the drawings the author has two 
choices: he may elect relief printing with 
Zinc line-cuts, or photo-offset from type- 
script. For the toned illustrations, he 
may choose photoengraving with printing, 
photo-offset from typescript with screened 
illustrations, or photogelatin. 

Note that in all these processes 
the stage in book production is reached 
after which the presence of illustrative 
material adds nothing to costs. In the 
printing process this stage does not arrive 
until the entire first cost is met and the 
press is ready to run; in the case of 
photo-offset of drawings, or photogelatin 
of drawings or half tones, the stage is 
reached when the photographic negative is 
trued up; in the case of photo-offset of 
half tones it is reached when the screening 
is completed. The whole process of etching

on metal and fitting metal to type is a 
part of a relief-printing cost, but not of 
a photo-offset or photogelatin cost. 

If the area cost of photogelatin 
work were the same as area cost of photo- 
offset, this process would be indicated for 
all combinations of photographs with text. 
Since the prices for this process are not 
highly standardized, an accurate table in- 
dicating the amount of screened photography 
in relation to the amount of text that 
would make photogelatin the favored proc- 
ess cannot be made. But the conclusion 
will probably stand that if the amount of 
text (i.e., the page area covered by text) 
is small enough in comparison with the area 
covered by pictorial matter, photogelatin 
will stand out as the best technique for 
the reproduction of an illustrated work, 

It must be emphasized again that in

_ the Peprocuuctioen of illustrations, as in 
all cases where area costs predominate, the 
costs are increased as the size of the il- 

_lustrations is increased, and diminished as 

their size is diminished. The alternatives 
confronting the author in this case are the 
Same as those which confront him in the re- 
production of the text itself, whether it 
is a reprint of an out-of-print book or a 
typescript book reproduced by photo-offset: 

phe can always cut costs by sacrificing 
size, and with size, beauty and legibility. 

There is another way in which pic- 
torial and textual matter may be combined. 

_The pictorial matter may be separately 
printed and then combined with the textual 
matter in the course of the bookbinding 
process. 

The effect of this method of com-— 
bining text and picture is to convert it 
MiurOuamcunnine cost, for the cost of bind= 
ing varies almost directly with the number 
of copies bound, and the cost of inserting 
extra pictures of sheets while gathering 

the folded pages of a book varies almost 
directly with the number of copies and the 
number of insertions per copy. 

it is not excluded that the author 
should have recourse to microcopying to lay 
illustrative material before his reader. A 

mcext might be issued in an edition of ap- 
propriate size, and the illustrative ma- 
temial to gO wlth 1t reproduced as a strip 

mot film, to be used by projection on a 

mscreen or in a reading machine. The cost 

levels at which such films can be manu- 

»factured and distributed will be discussed 

'in Chapter XII; it need only be noted at 

this point that the technique is at hand, 

and that it might lead to a practice of 
mear more copious pictorial illustrations 

“than the scholarly world has as yet dreamed 

of using. 











Summary 


The reproduction of pictorial mat- 
ter, like the texts, can be accomplished at 
costs varying over a wide range and permit- 
ting sales at normal prices or prices not 
eprcatlveim excess on normaly in editions 
varying through all the ranges of the pos- 
sible scholarly market, from that which is

er. 

That which is usually spoken as the 
Neosu" "or publishing a book, whether wi- 
lustrated or not, whether in ordinary Roman 
characters or mot, is only a vspecial in= 
stance of a great range of possible costs. 
It is usually the cost of applying a relief- 
printing technique to the distribution of 
an intellectual product to a non-commercial 
market. The difference between the prob- 
able income from a full, normal, commercial 
market and the anticipated income from an 
actual scholarly market is usually made up 
as a subsidy to the press, which has made 
no technological concessions to the situa- 
tion. The press publishes as if the book 
were to be sold to 2000-or more buyers and 
asks the sponsors of the publication to re- 
lieve it of the financial consequences of 
proceeding on this fiction.

A STUDY OF PAPER PERMANENCE 


This chapter has been subjected to criticism by the Bureau of 
Standards, and the Permanence and Durability Committee of the Techni- 


cal Association of the Pulp and Paper Industry. 
tested certain conclusions of the paper as originally submitted 


The latter body con- 
and 


has expressed a wish that the chapter be published as amended by then, 


if it is to be published with their approval. 


Comments and contro- 


versial material, therefore, which had been written in the original 


draft of this chapter and revised out of it, have sometimes been 


in- 


serted here as footnotes; the substance of the chapter as it stands 
without the footnotes has been issued separately as a report of the 
Technical Association of the Pulp and Paper Industry. 


The outstanding qualities required 
of a book paper are four: printing sur- 
face, opacity, strength, and permanence 
and durability. Other qualities of a great 
er or lesser importance are color, feel, 
formation, aesthetic value, etc., depend- 
ing on the purpose for which the paper is 
to be used. The printability, opacity, and 
strength qualities of book paper can be de- 
termined by suitable testing instruments 
and expressed in numerical terms. The 
fourth outstanding quality, namely, perma- 
nence and durability, is not as easily ex- 
pressed. Permanence of a paper has been 
defined as the degree of resistance towards 
the degrading chemical action of the impur- 
ities in the paper or of materials in the 
surrounding air. Durability is the degree 
to which the paper retains its original 
qualities under usage. In a 1984 report 
from the Bureau of Standards,! it was 
broughiteout that important factors im the 
permanence and durability of book papers 
in 
the sheet, and the conditions under which 
the books are kept. Paper from books 
stored in urban institutions is uniformly 
more deteriorated than that from identical 
volumes kept in rural libraries, according 
to the Bureau of Standards investigation. 
The much thumbed-over books in the chil- 
dren's department of the public library 


show the results of wear in use, but there 
is little doubt that the lasting quality of 
paper is not only dependent upon its en- 
vironment but is partly related to the pa- 
per itself. This permanence quality, how- 
ever, is not immediately apparent to the 
observer. The only absolute test of perma- 
nence and durability would require that one 
should wait to see what happens to the pa- 
per in the course of several centuries or 
until there is positive evidence of deteri- 
oration. 

In the days when paper was an in- 
novation in Europe, competing with parch- 
ment, it was regarded as dangerously im- 
permanent, and there was legislation to 
prohibit its use in legal documents. Of 
the books printed in the earlier centuries, 
enough have endured the effect of time to 
establish beyond question the permanence 
possibilities in papers made of the materi- 
als then in use. During the period 1875- 
LOO unpurLpved Toreerude= ta bens uasuciimas 
ground wood, were frequently used in book 
papers. The Bureau of Standards, in its 
report, to which reference has already been 
made, found that book papers containing ap- 
preciable quantities of crude fibers were 
invariably in poorer condition than those 
containing rag and chemical wood fibers. 
The period 1875-1910, therefore, is defined 
as one in which the paper in books published

ries," Bureau of Standards Miscellaneous Publications, No. 140.

in this period: may be quite impermanent. 
This served to emphasize the importance of 
the chemical purity of the fibers them- 
selves as a factor in the permanence of pa- 
per. At the beginning of the present cen- 
tury, paper technicians were calling atten- 
tion to the danger of printing on paper 
containing crude fibers, such as ground 
wood pulp. The conclusion was drawn at 
that time that papers had a life expectan- 
cy proportionate to the amount of rag stock 
used in their manufacture.® 

The distributing trade had little 
knowledge concerning the problem of paper 
permanence and durability. The market 
designations of paper ordinarily in use in- 
clude size, weight, color, surface finish, 
and a description of the raw materials from 
which the paper is made. The raw material 
may be described with varying degrees of 
precision. The simplest distinction is 
that which runs between "rag" and "wood 
pulp" papers, and those which contain dif- 
ferent proportions of beth. The rags, how= 
ever, are not of equal quality. The hard- 
est and most durable fibers are the new un- 
bleached cotton trimmings which are bleached 
in the paper mill. Then come the scraps 
left from the manufacture of overalls, "new 
blues;" then the white rags from wornout 
clothing from the housewife's rag bag;° and, 
finally, soiled rags of different colors 
from different sources.* The higher class- 
es of rags require less chemical treatment 
for paper stock and, therefore, yielda more 
permanent paper when carefully manufac-— 
tured. The lower classes of rags usually 
undergo a more drastic chemical treatment 
before being converted to paper and do not 
yield as strong or as permanent a paper, 
although for many purposes it may possess 
other more desirable properties.° The wood 
used in paper making is also subject to 
various classifications: there is the dis— 
tinction between the soft (coniferous) 
woods and the hard (deciduous) woods. Then 
there are different processes by which the 
wood is converted into pulp to receive con- 
sideration. First, there is the important 
distinction between "mechanical wood pulp" 


METHODS OF REPRODUCING RESEARCH MAT&amp;RIALS 





(groundwood) and "chemical wood pulp." 
Newsprint paper, for instance, is chiefly 
mechanical wood pulp; most book paper is 7 
made of chemical wood pulp. By different 
kinds of chemical treatment the impurities 


in the wood are removed and a fiber of rel- 


atively high purity, compared to a mechani- 
eal wood pulp fiber, is obtained.” "Soda 
pulp" is made by digesting wood chips in 
an alkaline solution, such as sodium hy- 
droxide, and is composed of fibers from 
hard woods. "Sulphite pulp," on the other 
hand, is made chiefly from soft woods by 
digesting the wood chips in a solution of 
sulfurous acid and calcium bisulphite. The 
fibers generally possess different proper- 
ties compared to those made by the soda 
process owing to their difference of-ori- 
gin. Recently certain additional processes 
giving further purification to chemical 
wood pulps have appeared. 

Within the past decade or so; some 
paper users have become dissatisfied with 
the more or less crude paper specifications 
and have begun to introduce laboratory pro- 
cedures in standardizing their paper pur- 
chases. The distributing trade has not 
followed this line of development, however; © 
its interests have been heavily vested in 
the existing trade practices. Recently 
some of the larger users of papers, who 
could establish direct contact with the 
manufacturers, began to demand and to re- 
ceive "specification papers." It is re=

A STUDY OF PAPER PERMANENCE 


probable longevity of a paper were not so 
easily set up but progress is being made in 
that direction. 

The librarians seem to have been 
the ones who showed the first and greatest 
desire for permanence in book papers, but 
they were in a bad strategic position for 
making their desires effective. They were 
many times removed from the paper manufac- 
turers; they had little influence on the 
publishers and none on the paper distribu- 
tors. The British Library Association set 
up a committee which drew up some perma- 
nence specifications for paper. In general, 
however, the paper trade continued to sell 
its goods as "100% rag," "50% rag," or 
"Sulphite" and induced the buyer to believe 
that the more he paid, the greater was the 
probable longevity of the paper. 

When the laboratory men began to 
work on paper specifications, not only was 
the source of the fiber studied but its 
chemical and physical qualities were ex- 
amined. The most important material com- 
prising the fibers used in papermaking is 
the organic substance known as cellulose, 
the cell wall of the plant, and its chemi- 
cal properties are essentially the same 


' whether it is found in the cottonseed hair, 


cornstalks, or trees, whether it goes to 
the paper mill as a discarded shirt or a 
spruce log. In all papers cellulose is the 
basic ingredient, although there is a big 
difference in the structure of different 
fibers and this is an important character- 
istic in papermaking. Furthermore, associ- 
ated with cellulose in the crude or unpuri- 
fied fiber, there are often undesirable sub- 
stances, called impurities, which are re- 
moved by chemical treatment as already in- 
dicated. These impurities vary in nature 
and in amount, depending on the source of 
the fiber. Ordinary pulp wood is composed 
of over 50% cellulosic material and "impur- 
ities" to the extent of about 30%. When 
newsprint paper is made by grinding logs 
into mechanical wood pulp, all the "impur- 
ities" or undesirable substances go into 
the paper. Raw cotton, on the other hand, 


_ represents a fiber containing about 90% 


ty 


cellulose and a minimum of "impurities." 


a7 


Tests which are often used to de- 
termine the purity and quality of the fi- 
bers composing a paper are: acidity, siz- 
ing, alpha cellulose, and copper number. In 
general, there is agreement among paper 
technologists that the acidity and the ros- 
in sizing should be kept low for a perma- 
nent paper. The alpha cellulose content of 
a paper refers to that portion of the cellu- 
lose which is not soluble in a solution of 
sodium hydroxide under certain defined con- 
ditions.6 These are entirely empirical con- 
ditions however. The alkali-resistant or 
alpha cellulose content of the cellulose 
portion of a paper is presumably proportion- 
ate to the fiber purity, a high percentage 
alpha cellulose value being desirable for a 
permanent paper. The copper number is also 
indicative of fiber purity, the higher the 
number the greater the degree of damage to 
the fibers. Other tests which have been 
used in specifying book papers for perma- 
nent records are: ash, folding endurance, 
bursting strength, opacity, weight, and 
thickness. No single test can be consid- 
ered at the present time as an adequate 
criterion of paper permanency. Even the 
lists of tests, mentioned above, yield a 
not too satisfactory picture of the proba- 
ble life expectancy of a paper as far as 
purity of the sheet is concerned. Other 
tests which may become more reliable in- 
dices of paper permanence are now in the 
process of development. 

Paper manufactured from the highest 
grade of cotton rags receives the minimum 
of treatment. The raw material itself is 
of a very high degree of purity and, care- 
fully processed, yields from known experi- 
ence a paper of very great permanence and 
durability. Such papers possess an alpha 
cellulose content well over 90% and « cop- 
per number considerably less than 1.0. Low- 
er grade rags and chemical wood pulps re- 
quire more severe treatment in their isola- 
tion or purification before being converted 
to paper. Ordinary processes of making 
chemical wood pulp do not yield a product 
with 90% alpha cellulose content. Purifi- 
cation processes are now available, how- 
ever, whereby the alpha cellulose content

of such pulps, referred to as "alpha pulps," 
approaches that of the better grades of cot- 
ton rags.! 

When purified, chemical wood pulps 
have proven very satisfactory for certain 
papers and as a substitute for certain 
grades of rags. With our increasing knowl- 
edge of paper, its raw materials and manu- 
facture, the future may provide a more per- 
manent paper made from a greater variety of 
materials. 


Proposed Classification and Specifications 


for Permanent Book Papers 


(1) Classification of Book Papers Rela- 
tive to Their Permanence Qualities® 


A system of classification of 
printing and writing papers relative to 
their permanence qualities has been suggest- 
ed by the United States Bureau of Stand- 
ards.? Mr. B. W. Scribner, of the Bureau 
of Standards, proposed that the ingredients 
to be specified be a percentage of alpha 
cellulose, and he suggested, as an addi- 
tional innovation, an accelerated aging test 
om "Stability" specification. Underlying 
this test is the assumption that paper de- 
terioration is a chemical action which can 
be accelerated by the influence of heat. 
Paper samples of known alpha cellulose con- 
tent, chemical purity, and physical strength 
are subjected to oven heat for seventy-two 
hours at 100° C., and then tested for loss 
of chemical and physical qualities. The 
loss is expressed as a percentage. Maks 
classification is based upon the purity and 
strength of the finished paper. The values 
given are derived from the results of the 
extensive investigations of the Bureau dur- 
ing the past four years into the permanence 
of paper. In these investigations, tests 
Similar to the ones described here have 
been made on a large number and variety of 
papers, and it is believed that papers ful- 











filling the requirements of the various 
groups will have the relative degrees 
permanence indicated.1l0 

Invthis systenvor classi ivcautom, 
all papers are divided into four classes. 
The first class contains those papers which 
may be expected to have maximum longevity. 
A book paper fulfilling the requirements of 
this class would be particularly suitable 
for bound volumes of records having perma- 
nent value. The second class contains pa- 
pers of high purity. Papers used for semi- 
permanent records and in fine editions of 
rare and costly books should fulfill the. 
requirements of this class. The thirdclass 
is composed of papers which, while not hav-— 
ing as high a degree of purity as those in 
the first two classes, have a fair degree 
of purity. Such papers could be used where 
moderate longevity is desired, such as in 
reference periodicals. Papers in the fourth 
class are those suitable for current use 
only.t1 Table XXXIV, on the following 
pages, illustrates in detail how such a sys-— 
tem of classification might be applied to 
book papers.

The paper must be made with every 
precaution to insure the maximum serviice-

to use the minimum quantities of bleach,

must not show the presence of any injurious 
residual chemicals which will interfere in 
any way with the permanency of color or -: 
the serviceability and durability of the 
paper.

processes and have put their highly purified pulp on the market as "solka fiber."

not certain as to how far such highly purified wood pulps can displace rag fibers as an ingredient for 


permanent papers.

The Paper Trade and the Proposed Specifica- 


tions 
The interest of the paper trade in 


_ specifications is recent and welcome. Tech- 





- judgment on permanence specifications, 





nical knowledge is far ahead of the market 
conditions. Some of the conclusions of pa- 
per technologists are in satisfactory agree- 
ment and can be used safely as a guide by 
publishers in search of permanent paper. 
However, on entering the market to buy pa- 
per, the publisher discovers that the dis-— 
tributing trade is not accustomed to the 
use of even the minimum specifications upon 
which there is agreement. 

The Rag Paper Division of the Writ- 
ing Paper Manufacturers! Association has 
suggested tentatively some specifications, 
which are set forth in a comparative table 
at the end of this chapter; but for a final 
cia 
awaits the conclusion of the experimental 
work in progress. 

A test made at the Bureau of Stand- 


ards confirms the fact that a purchaser who 


merely specifies a percentage of rag con- 
tent in a book paper has no assurance that 
he is paying for permanence quality. Thus 
is the importance of careful specifications 


| brought out. 


A list of the book papers investi- 
gated by John Burtonlé is herewith tabulat- 
ed (Table XXXV, on the following page) with- 
the proposed permanence classification in- 
dicated in each case. This is based on 
chemical and physical tests on the papers. 
For this proposed classification, see an 
earlier portion of this chapter.14 Accord- 
ing to this classification system only one 
of the twenty-eight papers studied could 
qualify as a permanent and durable paper, 
but several were only slightly deficient. 
The importance of careful processing of fi- 
bers was emphatically brought out as a re- 
sult of this investiscation., — Avtdiber tor 
initial high quality may have its purity 
seriously lowered by improper processing, 
and fibers of much lower original purity 
may be purified to a high degree by proper 
treatment. 

These data serve to bring out the 
importance of careful specifications in the 
matter of permanent and durable book pa- 
pers, no single test or specifications be- 
ing adequate.

A STUDY OF PAPER PERMANENCE 


chemical wood pulp, or mixture, should not 
be permanent papers; and emphasis has been 
on beauty and printability rather than on 
permanence and durability. Paper technolo- 
gists have the formulae for papers which 
would satisfy the demand for permanence but 
such a demand has not been large enough to 
control market practices. The lack of 
agreement over specifications has made it 
difficult for the buyers who want perma- 
nence to exert their full weight in the 
market, and the small buyer can have lit- 
tle influence even if he knows what he 
wants unless he happens to want a stock 
commodity. 

A number of specifications are in- 
cluded in an appended chart which gives, in 
addition, the properties and approximate 
prices of certain all-rag or purified chem 
ical wood pulp papers, actually or poten- 
tially available. 

How are these specifications to be 
interpreted? The paper technologists quick 
ly draw the layman beyond his depth in the 
discussion, but a few facts stand out as 
agreed or uncontested, and upon these the 
publisher may safely base his policy. 


(1) Fiber Content of Highest Class Pa- 


pers 

It is always insufficient to speci- 
fy merely a source of the fibers, as, for 
instance, "rag" or "50% rag." Now only 
should the quality of the fiber be speci- 
fied but specifications covering the manu- 
factured paper should be carefully drawn. 
These should include ash content, acidity, 
rosin sizing, alpha cellulose, copper num- 
ber, folding endurance, bursting strength, 
and perhaps other tests depending on the 
use requirements of the sheet. No one or 
two tests alone, any more than the source 
of the fiber, can entirely define the per- 
For instance, some of 
the new fillers now being used in book pa- 
pers will give a high false copper number 
without any other indication of imperma- 
nence. Others believe that a low alpha 
cellulose of rags which have been properly 
purified is not an index of impermanence. 
It is natural that the more information we 
have concerning the properties of a paper, 
the more can we judge of its general qual- 
ity and usability for the purposes we have 
in mind. 

Although it is admitted that there 








103 


is no general agreement on the specifica- 
tions necessary for a permanent paper made 
from fibers other than the highest grade of 
rags, the dealers and even the buying pub- 
lic in general have been slow to realize 
the need for and the significance of a per- 
manent book paper. When the buyers specify 
these superior properties in a paper, the 
manufacturers will quote prices consistent 
with the specifications and the desired 
product will be delivered. It lies with 
the buying public to assist the manufactur- 
ers to keep pace with the findings of the 
paper technologists. 


(2) Fiber Content of Second-Class Papers 
Price becomes a leading considera- 

tion among the less permanent papers, and 
specifications do not have to be as rigid 
as with the first-class papers. Thus, in 
the Burton classification for book papers 
of high purity for semi-permanent records, 
the chemical and physical constants are ex- 
tended considerably beyond those for book 
papers of maximum purity for permanent rec-— 
ords. The buyer should test and carefully 
check to specifications all papers before 
use in order to be sure he is getting his 
full money value. Again, no single test 
should be used as a criterion of the perma- 
nence quality of the paper under considera-— 
tion. 


(3) Ground or Mechanical Wood Pulp 
No groundwood or mechanical wood 
pulp should be present in any paper de- 
signed for anything more than temporary use. 


(4) Acidity 
It is undisputed that high acidity 


causes rapid deterioration of paper. Acidi- 
ty is measured in two ways: the acid num- 
ber is determined by volumetric analysis 

and indicates the amount of acid present, 
while the pH value is a measure of the hy- 
drogen-ion concentration or strength of the 
acid. A paper testing pH 4.5, for instance, 
is about 450 times more acid than one test— 
ing pH 6 and is more likely to become de- 
graded on this account. 


(5) Sizing Material 
The presence of large amounts of 


rosin as a sizing material in paper is like- 
ly to bring about a discoloration or yellow- 
ing in papers on aging. There is general 


104 


agreement that the rosin content of perma-— 
nent papers should be kept low, probably 
below 1%. 


(6) Fillers or Loading Materials 

There is not complete agreement as 
to the significance of mineral fillers for 
permanent and durable papers. Too much ma- 
terial will probably reduce the durability 
of the sheet, but a small amount of the 
proper filler does no harm in the opinion 
of many paper technologists. 


The Influerce of Price 

The paper buyer can be sure that 
any of these permanence specifications are 
better than none; they emphasize different 
elements of the paper, but they all agree 
in guiding the purchaser away from papers 
which have been manufactured (as many book 
papers are manufactured) without taking 
into account any permanence requirements 
whatsoever. 

The publisher who is using small 
quantities of paper stands two steps re- 
moved from the manufacturers. The trade is 
organized to distribute paper from manufac- 
turer to jobber or dealer and from there to 
printer. In some cases the manufacturing 
process is divided, one firm making the 
pulp and another the paper. Since the qual- 
ities which give a paper its permanence are 
due in large measure to the manufacture and 
processing of the pulp, it is especially 
desirable that the buyer should make a spe- 
cial effort to secure paper conforming to 
permanence specifications. 

If he enters the market with some 
permanence specifications he will probably 
find his printer, and the printer's jobber, 
unequipped with any tested papers. He may 
have to work his way back to the manufac-— 
turer. He will find that paper is sold 
normally in 500-pound cases, but that manu- 
facturers will often make a special run of 
paper for an order as small as 1 ton (4 
cases). The manufacturing and selling mits 
are case, ton and carload (15-18 tons). The 
trade is familiar with the practice by 
which price drops as the size of the order 
increases to the carload; these price vari- 
ations are of use in interpreting compara- 
tive pricing of paper, but of the greatest 
importance because they constitute an in- 
dex of the size of order which will have 
sufficient importance to induce a manufac- 








METHODS OF REPRODUCING RESEARCH MATERIALS 


turer to conform to permanence specifica- 
tions. 

The Joint Committee on Materials 
for Research has found some firms willing 
to have their paper quoted in terms of a 
price index. If "normal," i.e., low-cost 
book paper is $.08 a pound, then these pa- 
pers would be sold at the prices listed in 
the table. The Rag Paper Division of the 
Writing Paper Manufacturers! Association 
advises that if the base price is $.08, the 
price of a permanent paper meeting their 
specifications should be $.32. The prices 
named in connection with Government Print- 
ing Office specifications are those actual- 
ly bid in 1932. It must be observed that 
this relationship in prices prevails: the 
"offset book" paper (not for permanent use) 
was bought at less than $.04, and the "per- 
manent record book" paper at over $.16. It 
is evident, therefore, that large quantity 
orders and competitive bidding can reduce 
prices greatly, but the ratio between 
prices of papers of different qualities is 
not radically changed. 

Under normal trade conditions the 
trade mark-ups and discounts should permit 
price variations in the following scale: 

(A paper selling at $.05 a pound, i.e., 
$10.00 a case in 21/2 tonelorc 


Price from Manufacturer to Distributor 
Price per Case in Lots of: 


1 case 1) ton 24 tons 5 tons 18 tons 
(4 cases) (carloads) 
$11.00 $10.50 $10.00 $9.70 $9.50 


The distributor's mark-up would range from 
$1.60 in the one-case lots to an extreme 
low of $.50 to $,95 im carlosd Tots. The 
printer's mark-up should be anything from 
10% to 25% of what he pays the dealer. 
These mark-ups do not constitute an exces-— 
sive charge for the distributing service 
offered, nor do they greatly increase pub- 
LiVShiin gC Ose. 

How does paper cost figure into ' 
book cost? Paper is sold by the pound; a © 
standard size of sheet is) 25") x 733"; the 
weight of the paper is usually given as 
that of) S00ssheets m2 &gt;! exe SS oaie Comma 
sheet of this paper will print 24 pages, 
8" x 9 1/2", a ream will supply paper for 











A STUDY OF PAPER PERMANENCE

38 copies. Paper weighing 45 pounds to the 
ream--a good stout book paper weight, as 
the paper samples indicate--will make up a 
600-page book weighing a little over one 
pound. The difference between the highest 
and the lowest paper prices would not come 
to more than $.30 a volume, or less than 
10% of the cost of an edition of 300. If 
the edition is small, the use of the most 
expensive paper need not greatly increase 
the price of the book, but may greatly in- 
crease its utility. 

But most book manufacturing-—-prac-— 
tically all commercial book manufacturing 
---calls for larger editions, in which the 
eomposition and press charge is distributed 
over more copies, and the paper cost there- 
fore proportionately higher. Moreover, the 
economics of the publishing business re- 
quire that each book shall be printed in an 
edition larger than that for which there is 
immediate and certain sale. The chance of 
selling some of the overprint affords the 
prospect of profit. But the storage of un- 
sold volumes increases the paper cost which 
must be borne by the volumes actually sold. 
If in an edition of 1000 books, weighing 
one pound each, the cost of paper is in- 
creased $.07 a pound (from $.07 to $.14) 
the increased cost levied upon the purchas- 
er need not be more than $.07 a volume if 
the whole edition is sold; but if only 250 
copies are sold, the ratable portion of the 
added paper cost which each must bear rises 
‘to $.28. It is the storage of valuable pa- 
_ per in unsold books that makes it so cost- 
ly to use high-priced paper in commercial 
publishing. And therefore, two policies 
open out before those who would improve the 
' lasting quality of books. 

The first is the policy followed by 
_the New York Times: publication in two ed- 
_itions; one a small edition, for relatively 
certain sale, printed on expensive rag pa- 
_per of high durability and permanence; the 
- other an edition for temporary consumption. 
) But the publishers assert that in commer- 
cial publishing such a policy would intro- 
duce many new costs, not only on the press, 
mout in storing and filling orders. The 

_ American Library Association favors the ap- 
Mplication of this policy to government doc- 
' uments. 


The second policy is that which 
will be practicable as rag, purified chemi- 
cal wood pulp or other papers at moderate 
prices prove to have satisfactory lasting 
qualities. The permanence level of all 
book papers can be raised, without greatly 
increasing prices. A basic economic argu- 
ment‘helps at this point. The carefully 
manufactured rag papers with alpha cellu- 
lose content up to 97% can be manufactured 
to be more durable than a paper that mere- 
ly passes the proposed Burton Class I tests. 
But it cannot be widely used in the publish- 
ing industry because of cost; its useful- 
ness will lie in the small editions which 
do not threaten to leave their makers with 
a great bulk of expensive paper unsold on 
the shelves. The improvement of permanence 
qualities in the normal product of the pub- 
lishing trade must depend upon the develop- 
ment of less expensive papers. The buyer 
must be induced to demand what the techni- 
cians are able to make, a rag or purified 
chemical wood pulp paper manufactured for 
permanence, and sold at a moderate price. 


Preservation of Old Newsprint Paper 

Whatever improvement in standards of 
manufacture and choice of paper may be an- 
ticipated, it cannot affect the fifty 
years! legacy of inferior paper that has 
already been used and that now stands on 
our library shelves in imminent peril of 
dissolution. Newsprint paper is especially 
vulnerable. Can it be saved? 

The Bureau of Standards reached a 
certain point in devising a method of press-— 
ing sheets of cellulose acetate into the 
newsprint fiber in such a way that the air 
was excluded and tremendous folding endur- 
ance developed. This process required no 
adhesives. The New York Public Library 
protects some of its newspaper files by 
covering both sides of the sheets with Jap- 
anese tissue paper, then smoothing them by 
running them through a heated mangle. This 
process has been used by the New York Pub- 
Ce Gal pnaraven snc mh O.emmGe 2.) Dela vanincmCees 
creased somewhat, but the library feels 
that its experience indicates that this dis- 
advantage is offset by the increased 
strength and lengthened span of life of the

APPENDIX 


cs The following material was not ap- 

proved by the Technical Association of the 

Pulp and Paper Industry, but is printed 

S herewith, not as a part of the discussion 

carried above, but as supplementary infor- 

mation offered subject to the layman's 

medualms as to its accuracy. 

bs The Scribner-Burton specifications 
are as follows: 


EXCERPT FROM PAPER BY B. W. SCRIBNER, 
BUREAU OF STANDARDS, ON PERMANENCE 
STANDARDS FOR PAPER 


In consideration of both usage 
of papers and the grades of papers 
available, it is suggested that they 
might be classified in four main 
groups according to their degree of 
cellulose and non-cellulose purity, 
as related to their service require- 
ments. According to such mode of 
classification, the present domestic 
printing and writing papers may be 
grouped as follows: 


Grade I. Permanent papers, having a 
maximum degree of purity; free from 
unbleached fibers, and highly ligni- 
fied fibers such as groundwood. In- 
dicative chemical properties: alpha 
cellulose, 90%; copper number, 1.5; 
rosin, 1%; acidity, 5 pH; changes on 


similar plan for pasting a protective trans- 


_ preserved only by film-copying them and let- 


lem will be discussed in Chapter XI in con- 





heating 72 hours ne ioe Seca 
in content of alpha-cellulose should 
be not more than 1.5%, decrease in 
folding endurance not more than 25%, 
increase in copper number not more 
than 0.5. 


Grade II. Papers quite highly puri- 
fied that may be expected to have a 
minimum life of 100 years; free from 
unbleached fibers, and highly ligni- 
fied fibers such as groundwood. Indi- 
cative chemical properties: alpha 
cellulose, 80%; copper number, 2.5; 
rosin, 165%;. acidity, voeots 


Grade III. Papers having a fair de- 
gree of purity that may be expected 
to have a minimum life of 50 years; 
free from unbleached fibers and high- 
ly lignified fibers such as ground- 
wood. Indicative chemical proper- 
ties: alpha cellulose, 70%; copper 
number, 53; rosin, 2%; acidity, 5 pH. 


Grade IV. Papers having a low degree 
of purity containing considerable or- 
ganic impurities, suitable for cur= 
rent use only. This grade includes 
papers containing unbleached fibers, 
and highly lignified fibers such as 
groundwood. 


All figures for chemical com- 
ponents in these grade descriptions 
are upper limits, except for alpha 
cellulose contents which are lower 
limits. Alpha cellulose content and 
copper number are based on total cel- 
lulose content. 

As stated in these grade de- 
scriptions, the purity limits are 
given merely as indicative and are 
not suggested as specification re- 
quirements, for the fixing of specifi- 
cation details must necessarily be 
done by the consumers and manufactur- 
ers directly concerned. In each of 
these grades, the establishment of 
two or more strength requirements for 
each weight of paper is necessary. 
Also, as less strength is required in 
book papers than in writing papers, 
different strength ranges are neces- 
sary for these two classes of paper. 
The strength requirements, of course,

must be fixed with consideration of 
the kind and extent of mechanical 
stresses to which the paper will be 
subjected in its use. The strength 
gradations of the government papers 
should be of particular assistance in 
this respect, although as they refer 
to a testing condition of 50% rela- 
tive humidity, they should be modi- 
fied for commercial use to accord with 
the standard commercial testing con- 
dition of 65% relative humidity.

In an effort to make a practical dem—

manence, the Joint Committee received 
the coéperation of Dill and Collins, 
Paper Manufacturers of Philadelphia,

of highly purified wood-pulp paper. 
This paper was used for one-third of

To the publisher all this com- 
plexity is reduced to two simple ques- 
tions: what price shall he pay for 
book paper, and what weight shall he 
give to the rag—content specifica- 
tion as against other specifications, 
such as those stated in terms of al- 
pha cellulose content? 

Let it be supposed then that 
the evidence is clear and undisputed 
that high price alone, and rag-—con- 


tent specifications alone, offer no 
guarantee of permanence, and even 
though the technician soon draws the 


layman beyond his depth in the dis- 
cussion of specifications, a few 
facts stand out as agreed or uncon- 
tested. 





1. A paper meeting the Scrib- 
ner-Burton specifications for maxi- 
mum permanence, with a life probabil- 
ity greater than that of most of the 
all-rag book papers on the market, 
can be made without rags, from puri- 
fied wood fibers. 

ce. A paper capable of surviv- 
ing more severe tests than those pro- 
posed by Scribner, with a life proba- 
bility greater than that of the best 
purified wood-pulp paper, can be made 
of new muslin cuttings. 

5. The adoption and enforce- 
ment of specifications calling for 
either of the two papers described 
above would constitute an immense 
improvement over current practices. 

The difference in permanence 
between paper meeting Scribner speci- 
fications and paper surpassing those 








specifications is an unknown quantity; 
a definite estimate of the price dif- 
ference can be made: if permanent 
purified wood-pulp papers cost $.10 to 
$.15 a pound, then the special perma- 
nent rag papers should cost from $.16 
to $.35 a pound. ‘ 

Correspondence with a number 
of paper manufacturers has yielded 
the information tabulated as to papers 
now available on the market. -The re- 
sults of the tests are as given by the 
manufacturers themselves; they have 
not been checked. 

Because other paper manufac-— 
turers may wish to offer papers meet- 
ing these specifications, the writer 
has asked the Rag Paper Manufacturers! 
Association, Springfield, Massachu- 
setts, and the American Pulp and Pa- 
per Association, New York City, to 
receive the names of manufacturers who 
may wish to offer products conforming 
to these specifications, and transmit 
them to prospective paper purchasers 
upon request. 

The following firms are among , 
those which will test papers to cover 
all the particulars of the specifica- 
tions tabulated:

Bond Papers and Onionskin 
Another field in which perma- 


nence is of great importance is that 
of bond papers, used for typescript 
correspondence and records of the 
archival type, and also in connection 
with the various near-print methods 

of reproducing text, such as mimeo- 
graph and hectograph. The general 
business practice of the country calls 








A STUDY OF

for a more permanent stock of paper 
for letters than for books, and a 
less permanent stock for carbon cop- 
ies than for books. The average bus- 
iness letter sheet will last longer 
than the average book page; the aver- 
age carbon copy will fall to pieces 
sooner. 

As the problems of archive 
administration in business become bet 
ter understood, it will no doubt be- 
come apparent that the carbon copies 
of certain classes of correspondence 
require more permanence qualities 
than the originals themselves, since 
they constitute the firm's records of 
its own commitments. The greater part 
of business correspondence is system- 
atically destroyed after a period of 
a few years, but for those classes of 
business correspondence that are in- 
tended for permanent preservation, it 
is appropriate to insist upon paper 
specifications comparable to those 
used for permanent record books. Onion-— 
skin papers of rag content are avail- 
able, and the Eaton Paper Company has 
developed a line of purified wood-pulp 
onionskin paper. Some of their lit- 
erature credits this line with 93% al- 
pha cellulose. Test data supplied by 
the Brightwater Paper Company on the 
same or a similar line shows alpha 
cellulose content of 88.25, copper 
number 1.68, and loss of folding en- 
durance in accelerated aging, 37%. The 
writer has not explored the bond paper 
field except in a haphazard way, but 
believes that in the main the techno- 
logical considerations governing per- 
manence are the same for bond as for 
book papers, and that the argument for 
using chemical and performance speci-

Beauty and Legibility in Papers 

The analysis of the paper 
situation from the standpoint of per- 
manence has not taken into account the 
paper quality upon which the buyers 
of paper are most insistent, namely, 
beauty. The importance of an attrac- 
tive paper in scholarly publishing is 
MOWm euOMen a Goma mic ta Cm COmtrsaa Dita ora 
to the quality of a finished book, but 
also its relation to legibility. dey 
has been demonstrated repeatedly that 
the legibility or attractiveness of a 
printed text is the product of many 
variables, such as size of type, for— 
mat of page, and use of print face as 
against typescript letters. It is 
clear that paper quality also enters 
into legibility as an important vari- 
able. It seems quite probable that 
the product of the hectograph, with 
its light purple ink, could be made 
more legible and attractive if run on 
a yellow-ivory paper. A reader choos- 
ing between typescript and print face 
on a book page would have his choice 
materially affected if the print face 
should be offered on an unattractive 
paper, the typescript on a beautiful 
one. And here again a fundamental 
rule of small edition publishing must 
be respected: that because the paper

CHAPTER IX 





BINDING, VERTICAL FILING, AND FILM STORAGE 


The use of typescript and near- 
print in the production of small editions 
of documents of internal circulation in 
scholarship need not necessarily give rise 
to new library problems. If most of these 
documents turn out to be books of size ap- 
propriate for binding, the librarian need 
not be subjected to any change in routine 
corresponding to the change in the methods 
of distributing written matter among schol- 
2S ble nea showldy develop that. a con= 
siderable proportion of these documents of 
internal circulation are of less than book 
size, the librarian will find that the dif- 
ficulty he already knows with his pamphlet 
problem increases. This problem is al- 
ready supplemented by that of provision for 
books on film. How may the different forms 
of written material entrusted to the li- 
brarian's care be most conveniently and 
economically preserved? What are the costs 
of keeping this material in suitable condi- 
tion for continued use?

ment that is more than half an inch thick 


is likely to be bound and treated as a book. 


Documents of less than that thickness may 
be shelved in pamphlet binders or combined 
in groups to form volumes of ordinary book 
size. An alternative treatment is that 
used for loose-leaf material, that is, to 
store them in vertical filing cases with 
folders and guides to make them easily ac- 
cessible, or to lay them in manuscript box- 
es to preserve them as safely as possible. 
Microcopied material in the form of film 
rolls may be kept in small boxes, labeled 
and shelved like books. Three types of 
costs appear here: filing, binding, and 
library shelving. The latter are discussed 
ede Caen we rae les 


Vertical Filing 
The vertical filing system, rather 








than ordinary library shelving, is used for 
the temporary Storage of items of pamphlet 
or typescript memorandum size. When a con- 
siderable volume of this material accumu- 
lates, two alternatives present themselves. 
If the vertical file system is adopted for 
the permanent storage of pamphlets and 
typescript, the library pays at the rateof 
$5.00 or $6.00 per 1000 pages for storage 
equipment. If the accumulation is bound as 
periodicals are bound, when enough articles 
on a subject have been brought together, 
the cost of binding the contents of a file 
drawer in books averaging one inch in thick 
ness would be from $20.00 to $30.00; in 
books averaging four inches in thickness, 
it would be from $10.00 to $20.00, with a 
button binding being used. The choice be- 
tween these two courses depends as much 
upon the nature of the material itself as 
upon cost considerations. 





(a) Vertical File Material 
A simple form of binding used for 
vertical file material up to forty or fifty 
pages in length is wire stapling. This is 
done with the small stapling machine, cost- 
ing about $5.00, that is part of standard 
office equipment. The cost is almost ex- 
clusively a labor cost. 5000 staples can 
be purchased for $2.00. A worker can sta- 
ple about 500 to 600 documents an hour at 
a labor cost of $.40. Wire stapling by a 
commercial service shop costs about $.02 a 
copy. Machine stapling, including a suit-— 
able paper cover, is available at a cost 
of a few cents a copy. This will take care 
of items up to 1/4" in thickness. Wire 
stapling through the fold is not suitable 
for ordinary typescript on typescript pa- 
per, but att can be used) for any printed sor 
photo-offset items published in one signa- 
ture of sixteen or thirty-two pages. 

Spiral binding is a formof notebook 
binding that is becoming increasingly popular 
TOMI Gane alate wima tena alone te helIcs Gael pe 
peared a few years ago in Europe and was

introduced in America through an American 
magazine. It is used fcr pamphlets and 
catalogues in Europe and for small edition 
publications. Loose sheets are held to- 
gether by rings as in the simplest loose- 
leaf notebook style, but instead of two or 
three heavy rings, a series of thin wire 
ones is fastened along one side of the 
sheets to be bound together. The advan- 
tages are that the book lies perfectly flat, 
is absolutely flexible, the inside margins 
are not obscured in any way, and there is 
no trouble with a double spread of page. 
The price is determined by two factors: 
quantity and length of the side to be spi- 
ral bound. An 11" side, which is the com- 
mon sone used ini school’s, im quantities of 
1000, with each copy 1/4" in thickness, 
would cost approximately $50.00. The price 
goes down as the quantity increases, 2500 
copies getting a 10% discount; 10,000 hav- 
ing a 20% discount, etc. 

Spiral binding has not been unani- 
mously approved by librarians. They claim 
that it is hard to keep on the shelves and 
meeds more storage space. Also, there is 
no place on the back of the book for title, 
author, or reference number; and this makes 
it necessary to take each spiral-—bound item 
off the shelf to ascertain if it is the de- 
sired copy. The Spiral Binding Company 
suggested the use of labels, to be pasted 
on the shelves immediately below the books 
in question. The question of permanency 
was also raised by the librarians. In an- 
swer to this, tests were made between spi- 
ral binding and thread-sewn books that 
seemed to prove that sheets could be pulled 
out of thread-sewn books more easily than 
out of spiral-bound books. The number of 
rings tends to make a stronger binding. An 
example of its use may be found in Dr. 
Charles C. Peters! thesis material, which 
has been published in reduced-size offset. 


Binding: (b) Pamphlet and Periodical Ma- 
terial 


For items of pamphlet thickness, 
four binding techniques are available: 
namely, the spiral binding and the stapling 
mentioned above, pasting, and wire stitch- 
ing. Pasting, next to ‘stapling, is the 
simplest method of fastening sheets of a 
pamphlet together, one fold inside of an- 
other. This method, however, is for bind-— 
ing only a few sheets and is for very tem- 
porary work. 


METHODS OF REPRODUCING RESEARCH MATERIALS 





There are two common methods of 
wire stitching: saddle-and side-wire 
stitching. With saddle-wire stitching, the 
pamphlet is opened in the middle and layed 
face down (or face up). The stitching is 
done on a machine which holds a spool of 
wire from which staples are made and driven 
through the sheets in the fold and clinched 
on the other side. Side-wire stitching is 
the same method, except that the stitching 
is done through the side of the collected 
sheets instead of through the fold. Saddle- 
wire stitching is used when sheets are fold- 
ed as one signature; side—wire stitching ds 
used when two or more Signatures are gath- 
ered side by side. Wire stitchers can be 
used for items up to 1/2" in thickness. 

Pamphlet producers, like periodical 
publishers, usually pass their binding 
costs on to the library. Library binderiles 
have attained a distinct recognition in the 
bookbinding industry in recent years, and 
are now considered as being a separate 
branch of bookbinding. The United States 
Census Bureau, -in its 1925 statistical re= 
port on the binding industry, put library 
binderies in a class by themselves. The 
American Library Association in 1922 had a 
meeting with the Employing Bookbinders of 
Ameria and the two groups drew up some 
principles to be observed in library book- 
binding. 

The library, in assuming the costs 
of pamphlet and periodical binding, some- 
times puts them in separate bindings, but 
usually groups them and binds them into 
volumes for reference. The publishers of 
periodicals generally have the responsibil- 
ity of determining how many issues of a 
magazine constitute a volume. Monthly 
school magazines, usually issued ten times 
a year, form a volume for each ten numbers; 
magazines issued each month during the year 
generally form a volume every six months. 
Extra thick volumes of magazines and news- 
papers must receive special care and usual- 
ly have to have reinforcement in the form

periodical or pamphlet producer uses a suf-

binders. 

The only justification for trans-— 
ferring the cost of adequate binding to li- 
braries is a situation in which a substan-— 
tial proportion of an edition is distributed 


,

BINDING, VERTICAL FILING, AND FILM STORAGE 





to users who will not require that it be 
well bound. If an entire edition of a 
pamphlet is to go to libraries which will 
catalogue and shelve it, it might as well 
be bound with boards heavy enough to sus- 
tain library use. If, on the other hand, 
the edition is to go principally to users, 
whether libraries or individuals, who will 
put it in a vertical file, the heavy cover 
boards are not only an unnecessary cost, 
but an actual disadvantage. 


Binding (c) Bookbinding Techniquest 
In the case of books of full stand- 


ard thickness, saddle stitching, side 
stitching, and sewing are most commonly 
used. With side stitching, the pages do 
not lie flat when opened, but must be held 
open; sewed and saddle-stitched books lie 
flat and show the full inside margin. 

Side stitching is done by making 
small holes in the sheets near the back and 
passing the thread through these holes. If 
the stitching is done by machine, punches 
are used to make the holes. 

Saddle stitching is done through 
the folds of the signatures. The stitches 
are made long to prevent weakening of the 
book by too much perforation, Usually a 
Sur LOO mis tim or crash is glued on the 
back for reinforcement. 

In sewed books (and the great ma- 
jority of books are sewed) each signature 
is sewed to its neighbor, so that an un- 


limited number of signatures may be con- 
tained in a book. These signatures are 
piled together and cords or tape are fas- 


tened crosswise across the back in grooves 
made for the purpose and fastened in the 
grooves by kettle stitching. The usual 
number of cords used is five. The finished 
product is a flexible and strong piece of 
work. When the signatures have been gath- 
ered and sewed, the edges are trimmed and 
the back rounded and reinforced with muslin 
Ceecracst lta c during thas reinthorcing 
process that the headbands are added. Then 
the filler is ready for its cover and the 
finishing steps. 

Paper is an important factor in 
binding and should be flexible in propor- 
tion to its size. When the grain of the 
paper runs the same way as the binding edge,

the book will lie flat when opened; if the 
grain runs crosswise of the binding edge, 
the book will not lie flat when opened, but 
will be stronger. In handmade paper, the 
fibers run in all directions, so the paper 
is equally strong in any position. 


(d) Bookbinding Costs 
There are many factors aside from 
the technique of binding that determine the 
cost of bookbinding, which is fundamentally 
el asblabalaliayes (elos\ae, shal leyoxeylie jopstoyeybichealopal, {ys} alice 
increases with the size of the edition. The 
most important factors are: (a) size fac- 
tors: number of pages, signatures, and 
copies, and the size of the book; (b) ma- 
terials factors: weight of paper, number 
of cords or tapes used in sewing, kind of 
cover material (leather, imitation leather, 
buckram, cloth, or paper); (c) style fac- 
Orsi. headbands, treatment of corners 
(round or square), treatment of fly leaves 
(tipped or turned), stamping or lettering, 
and treatment of illustrative material (sig- 
natures or single pages, placed at end of 
book of interleaved with text). : 

Though it is obviously insufficient 
to speak of an "average" library book, 
nevertheless, a sample quotation on the 
cost of bookbinding in a style suitable for 
library shelving will illustrate the gener- 
GUeCOStuLevel,. (ies costs,.acu shows 
Table XXXVI on the following page, are based 
on a good library binding of cloth vellum,

The cost of binding newspapers or 
large quantities of typescript (such as the 
NRA hearings) enters into the cost analysis 
that will help determine whether such ma- 
terials should be preserved by binding and 
Shelving or an microcopy, Lorm. sit 2s sig= 
nificant that the costs of binding a year's 
issue of a newspaper like the New York Times 
(approximately 20,000 pages, twenty-four 
volumes) amounts to $54.00, and storage 
costs would be from $48.00 to $72.00, while 
the cost of storage space required for the 
film copy of the same material would be 
about $1.50. 


Film Storage 
There are three ways of storing 
microcopied material on 16 mm. or 35 mn.

film strips. They can be mounted flat, 
Storedein rolls, or on spools. Flat mount— 
ing on cards (suggested by Mr. Atherton 
Seidell) is adapted only to very short 
strips, no wider than a card used in a ver- 
tical file system--hence 5" to 11" is a 
maximum length of strip. Roll storage is 
adapted to the lengths such as those pro- 
duced in the Leica or EKA camera--5!' to 15". 
The separate lengths of film are placed in 
receptacles which may be either small tin 
pill boxes or larger partitioned metal or 
paper boxes holding twenty-five rolls of 
film. The longer rolls of film require 
spool storage. The Recordak Corporation 
furnishes spools with its film. Each spool

much special care of atmospheric condi- 
tions is necessary in the preservation of 
the ordinary cellulose acetate "safety" 
film used in copying documents. The re- 
search under way at the Bureau of Stand- 
ards will result in information upon this 
important cost factor in film storage, The 
storage of nitrate films is very expensive 
because of fire hazards; the storage of 
cellulose acetate films is not complicated 
by any fire hazard.

Text of Thomas W. Lamont's 


apesch last night is on Page 8. 





‘Thomas W. Lamont of J. P. Mor 
gan &amp; Co. told the Academy of Po- 
litical Science at its annual dinner In 
the Hotel Astor last night that two 
vital changes were needed as primary 
steps for banking reform im the 
United States—to bring all commer- 
cial banks, large or small, under the 
Federal Reserve System and to es- 
tablish ‘‘sensible” provisions for re- 
gionel branch basking, If such re 
forms were brought about gradually, 
be asserted, they should result in 
“some measure of banking stability." 

Pointing to the fact that 60 per 
eont of the country’s banks, with re- 
sources of more than $13,000,000,000, 
were outeide the Federal Reserve 
System, the banker declared that no 
banking system can function ade 
quately with only a limited number 
of banks within it. He asserted that 
despite the great number of bank 
failures in recent years, the country 
still has too many banks, and that 
“thousands of banks lack proper 
safeguards.” Banking units should 
be larger than they are, he went on, 
and small, ill-capitalized institutions 
should be merged to gain the advan- 
tages of larger banks, 


Most Failures in Rural Districts, 


‘Mr. Lamont emphasized that nearly 
four and one-half times as many 
non-member banks have falled as 
members of the Federal Reserve. 
Most of these failures, be went on, 
were small country banks, under no 
control from the Federal Reserve 
and with such small pafd-in capital 
as to be ‘subject to impairment un- 
der the most ordinary conditions of 
difficult times.’ Ninety per cent of 
the banks that -alled between 1921 
and 1930, he continued, were in rural 
communities, “subject to the viclssi- 
tudes of crop failures or of the ex- 
pansion and deflation of business 
booms, without any of the protection 
afforded by a parent institution for- 
titled with ample capital and man- 
aged by experienced men.” 

Almost ail of the failures of small 
suburban banks around Chicago this) 
year, Mr. Lamont asserted, could| 
have been avoided if the Illinois laws 
had permitted branch banking. He 
id that the lessons must be obvious 
of a situation in which {t was im-| 
possible under the law for the large 
Chicago banks to serve the suburbs 
through branch banks. | 

Mr, Lamont said that mismanage- 
ment of large city banks, although! 
there bad been striking instances of | 
it, was rare compared to mismanage- 
ment of country banks, It was the 
weaknesses in the rural banks that 
Jed to hoarding on a grand scale last 
year, he declared, He went on that 
the need last year was not for curv 
rency, but for credit ald, but that! 
sound credit riske were not available 
for the banks because of the defla- 
tion in security and commodity 
prices. There had never been @ 
fime, he said, when the facilities of 
the Federal Reserve System had not 
been more than ample to meet al) 
legitimate credit needs. 

Confusion In Banking Laws. 

Lazity in granting ¢harters 
banks and in supervising their con- 
duct, Mr, Lamont continued, was @ 
result of the confusion due to the 
varying Federal and State banking 
Jaws, giving forty-nine different sets 
ef banking laws. 

Mr. Lamont assertéd that the Fed- 
eral Reserve System Imad brought 
“immeasurable benefits'’ to Ameri- 
an industry and commerce and that 
our plight would have been much 
worse without it. The system's open- 
market policy during the past six 
months, he said, had proved a great

Thomos W. Lamont, in Me ad-

WASHINGTON, Nov. 18.—While 
President Hoover and his Cabinet 
struggled today with the problem of 
reducing expenditures so that heavy 
additional tax levies would be un- 
|Recessary, members of Congres 
, discussing the situation, expressed 
hope that such @ solution could be 
found, 
| One point was definitely estab- 
lished, following the Meeting of the! 
President and his advisers, namely: 
that reports that the administration 
would recommend @ program of re- 
trenchment for the fiscal year 1934 
to the extent of $500,000,000 were 
accurate. Decision:was deferred on 
|whether a formal recommendation 
for tax legislation In the phort ses- 
sion of Congress also would be nec- 
epsary, 

Detajls of the retrenchment pro- 
gram were withheld, but it is known 
that the appropriations sought by 
every department are being carefully 
ansiyzed and that a definite Plan to 
bring the budget to a balance In 1934 
will be placed before Congress to ac- 
cept or reject. 

It Is understood also that the diffi- 
culties of budget balancing for the 
current fiscal year are considered 
virtually insurmountably, even if new 


taxeg are levied which would be/ 
effective in the remaining seven 
months. 


Economy Preferred to Tax Rise. 
The general attitude of members of 
Congress was to withhold a definite 
statement as to the necessity of new 
taxes, pending recommendations from 
the executive branch,

Special (o Tau New Yor Trurs, 
Nov. 18.—Presi- 
dent Hoover gave intensive consid- 
eration today to the war debt sug- 
gestions which he will submit to 
Governor Roosevelt at their confer- 
ence next Tuesday, but how far he 
will go in proposing a new approach 
tothe problem remained undisclosed. 

Dividing his time between war 
debts and the framing of the budget, 
Mr. Hooyer held a long session with 
his Cabinet this morning, and this 
afternoon conferred on war debts, 
first with Secretary of State Stimson 
and then with Secretary Mills and 
Director Roop of the budget. After- 
ward it was stated authoritatively 
that the President would have a debt 
plan to submit to the President-elect. 

The question of how far he will be 
Prepared to go with his views, how- 
ever, it wi id, undoubtedly would 
depend upon whether Mr. Roosevelt 
bes definite proposals to offer or 
whether, in the absence of any defi- 
nite suggeations, he will be prepared 
to approve, perhaps with modifica- 
tons, the proposals of the President. 


Roosevelt Ready for Longer Visit. 


A possibility that the discussions 
between Mr. Hoover and Mr. Roose- 
volt might extend beyond Tuesday 
developed today when the Mayflower 
Hotel announced that Governor 
Roosevelt would stay there and had 
made arrangements “definitely” to 
remain over Tuesday night. He has 
not set any time for his departure 
from Washington, it was added, 
the event the war debt discussions 
with President Hoover ct the White 
House continue for several days.” 

Reservations also have been made 
at the Mayflower for James A. Far- 
ley, chairman of the Democratic Na. 























tional Committee; Frank C. Walker, | 





its treasurer. and Professor Raymond 
Moley, the President-elect's adviser 
on economic affairs. 

Should the discussion between the 
President and the President-elect get 
nowhere, it was felt in political 
circiea here that the conference Mr. 
Hoover has called for Wednesday 
with leading members of the Senate 
Finance and the House Ways and 
Means Committee may provide 
lea4 for some affirmative approach 
to the debt question. 

In the absence of any direct word 
from the White House or Albany, 
sentiment in Congress appeared to- 
day to be as firmly opposed to the 
re-creation of the Debt Commission 





| for re-examination of the debtor gov- 


ernments’ capacity to pay as it is to 
the suspension of the Dec. 15 pay- 
ments, 

Most Senators were of the opinion 
that President Hoover would suggest 
&amp; revival of the Debt Commission, 
and they not only promptly declared 
against such a course but insisted 
that they would stoutly oppose any 
move for deferring of the Dec. 18 in- 
terest payment. 

Senator Borah, chairman of the 
Foreign Relations Committee, how- 
ever, thought that the President, 
after his talk with President-elect

NEW YORK, SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 19, 


ALBANY, Nov. 18.—Franklin D. 
Roosevelt in his Thanksgiving Day 
Proclamation as Governor today 
called for special consideration for 
|those in distress, including In it = 
Prayer from the Episcopal Book of 
Common Prayer which mentioned 
the ‘forgotten man.” 

“Remember in pity," says the 
prayer, ‘such as are this day desti- 
tute, homelesa or forgotten of thelr)

This petitfon was chosen because it 
contained an appeal the Governor 
| thought most appropriate to th 
times. His proclamation read: 

I, Franklin D, Roosevelt, Gov- 
ernor of the State of New York, 
do proclaim Thursday, the twénty- 
fourth day of November, in this 
year of our Losd one thousand 
nine hundred and thirty-two, as 
Thanksgiving Day. 

I ask the people of the State to

It is fitting that men and women 
of all creeds should join in the 
words of the prayer: 

“O God, almighty and merciful, 
who healest those that are broken 
in heart, and turnest the sadness 
of the sorrowful to joy; let thy

‘WENDEL ‘SON'S’ CLAIM 
REJECTED AS FRAUD 


Foley Throws Out Morris Case 
—To Send Record to Crain 
for “Immediate Action.” 





AUTHOR OF PLOT A MYSTERY 


Surrogate Rules After Wedding 
Certificate of 1876" Is Proved | 
Forgery Printed After 1913. 


The claim of Thomas Patrick Mor- 
|ris, Brooklyn house painter, to filial 
kinship with John G. Wendel and| 
through that to rightful ownership | 
of the $30,000,000 Wendel estate was) 
thrown out as ‘false and a forgery" 
by Surrogate Foley yesterday. Surro- 
gate Foley announced he would send 
the record to District Attorney Crain, 
with the hope that it would ‘receive 
prompt attention, 

Indignant that such cases could 
“come into court rooms,” Surrogate 
Foley with a bang of his gavel put 
an end to the claim once described 
by Arthur Garfield Hays, attorney 
for other Wendel claimants, as the 
“most interesting court room mys- 
tery of our time.” 

Attorneys for Morris and for the| 
state of Miss Ella von E, Wendel, 
the last of the Wendels, who suc-| 
cessfully fought the claim brought 
by the elderly and ailing Scotsman, 
joined last night in wondering if the 
mystery of who prepared his claim 
would ever be unraveled. They were 
agreed that Morris had not been the 
author of the documents produced by 
him or in his behalf. 

John M. Harlan, trial counsel for 
the estate, which Miss Ella Wendel 
left to various charitable institutions, 
ended the presentation of evidence 
yesterday by proving that the mar 
riage certificate purporting to at- 
test the wedding of John G. Wendel 
and Mary Ellen Devine at Castle 
Garden on June 11, 1876, had been, 
printed by the A. J, Holman Com- 
pany of Philadelphia . makers of 
Bibles, not earlier than 1918 and not 
later than 1923. 

This evidence was put in through 
the testimony of Elbridge W. Stein, 
an examiner of questioned docu- 
ments of many years’ court experi- 
ence. Mr. Stein showed how, through 
microscopic and stereoscopic exami- 
nation of the certificate, together 
|with many other similar certificates 
printed by the same company, he 
»had come to his conclusion. 


Traced Through the Years. 


Willlam K, Holman, head of the 
house founded by his grandfather, 
jidentified the certificate by Morris 
as one of a type which the publishers 
had begun including in their family 
Bibles in 1885. Through him Mr. 
Harlan introduced fourteen large 
Bibles, printed in varying years from 
| 1873 to 1923, in each of which was 
a marriage certificate. 

Then Mr. Stein traced through 
these certificates the deterioration of 
ithe plates from which they had been 
jprinted. As the electrotype.was used 
|more and more, it became more and 
more imperfect. Microscopie exami- 
nation, presented through enlarged 
photographs, showed parts of letters 
chipped in some places, worn away 
in others, with various other disar- 
rangements of the typogrephical lay- 
out of the certificate. 

Mr. Stein analyzed particularly the 
worn places on a certificate printed 
im 1913. Then, taking up the Morris 
certificate, he showed every worn or 
defective mark found on the 1913 
certificate. He jumped then to 1923 
and showed that on the Morris cer~ 
tiflcate there appeared other imper- 














fections which were again visible on 
the 1923 certificates, but which had 
not developed in 1913. 

In this way the date of the printing

ROOSEVELT HEARS 
HUNGER MARCHERS 


Surprises Delegation of Three 
by Listening to Pleas and 
Debating With Them. 





THEIR DEMANDS REJECTED; 


As “Private Citizen" He Can't 
Teli Hoover to Clear Their Way 
—Holds State Aid Adequate. 





Bpecial to Tre Naw York Tnoes. 

ALBANY, Noy. 18.—Franklin D. 
Roosevelt surprised three “hunger 
march’ Jeadéra today by receiving 
them readily in the quiet of the Ex- 
ecutive Mansion study and reasoning 
with them calmly about thelr de 
mapds. 

Gathered in a semicircle before 
him, the men, one with his collar 
open at the neck, found the Gover- 
nor ready to match statements with 
them in an even-tempered but firm 
mann: 

Secret Service men, guarding him 
ns President-elect, were near by as 
Mr. Roosevelt talked with the 
“‘marchers,"" who by thelr own ad- 
mission belonged to a group which 
invaded the Legislature last year. 

Three’ main demands were pre- 
sented by the delegation: A special 
session of the Legislature to appro- 
priate $100,000,000 for immediate help 
to the unemployed; an order thtow- 
ing open all the armories in the 
State, and provision of food and 
transportation for the ‘hunger 
march" to Washington, and a guar- 
antee that the marchers would not 
be molested by the police of New 
York cities. 

All of these were rejected. by the 
Governor. When he was asked to 
“tell President Hoover to let them 
come to Washington without any in- 
terference,"’ he replied emphatically: 

“I am just a private citizen and I 
cannot tell the President to do any- 
thing.” 

Members of the Delegation. 

The delegation was composed of 
two New Yorkers, Sam Wiseman, 
chairman, and Richard Sullivan, 
secretary of the conference for 
Winter relief, and Milton Stone of 
Schenectady, chairman of the New 
York State “hunger marchers." 

When word reached Albany Police 
Headquarters that the men were on 
thelr way here, a cordon of local 
police had been sent to guard the 
Executive Mansion, but no trouble 
of any kind erose. 

They had arrived about noon and it 
was obvious from thelr manner that 
they hardly expected a conference 
with the Governor. Since his election 
to the Presidency very few visitors 
have crossed the threshold. 

On hearing the mission of the 
three, the Governor almost at once 
directed that they be brought to his 
study. The secret service men as- 
sembled, as they always do when @ 
delegation calls, and a few minutes 
later the newspaper men were in- 
vited to sit in on the conference. 

Leaning «forward in his chair Mr. 
Roosevelt Matened carefully as the 
three spokesmen voiced their views. 
He continually challenged the ac- 
curacy and reasonableness of their 
statements, But did so almost with- 
out lifting his voice. 

‘As they told of their plans, he re- 
marked: 

“Every person has a perfect right 
to travel. Naturally the Governor 
hopes that the police throughout the 
State will exercise humane methods 
and give fair treatment." 

"Yea," retorted Stone. ‘We got 
falr treatment on March 2 two years 
ago.” 

He was referring to the disorder 
when a group of alleged Communists 
invaded the Legislature to demand 
relief appropriations. Several per-

The fusion movement looking to- 
| Ward Tammany’s overthrow in the 
1933 Mayoralty election continued to 
grow yesterday, but the situation 
was complicated by the possibility 
that the real fight for control of the 
city government might be waged in 
the Democratio primary next Sep- 
tember. 

That fight could be made, in the 
opinion of political observers, only if 
Franklin D. Roosevelt used his po- 
sition and prestige as President to 
back an anti-Tammany Democratic 
movement here, a movement that 
would have as its nucleus the Bronx 
organization of Edward J. Flynn. 

It would depend as well, it was 
said yesterday, on the winning to 
the Roosevelt camp of John H. Me- 
Cooey, Brooklyn leader, and the 
breaking up of the McCooey-Curry 
alliance. 

Joseph M. Price, an official of the 


ganizer of the movement in 1913 that 
resulted in the election of John Pur- 
roy Mitchel, announced that a meet- 
ing had been called for Nov. 28, to 
be held at the City Club, to gather 
under one central committee the 
anti-Tammany elements. He empha- 
sized that it merely would be a com- 
mittee to organize a fusion move- 
ment, and that it would not seek to 
pick a candidate for many months. 
Others stressed the danger of com- 
mitting the fusion movement to the 
candidacy of any man at present. 

Among those who have already 
said they would attend the confer- 
ence at *he City Club are Charles C. 
Burlingham, Henry De Forest Bald- 
win, Frederick L. Cranford, Ber 
narg 8. Deutsch, Leo Arnstein, Ken- 
neth Dayton, Kenneth M. Spence,

man, Raymond V. Ingersoll, Cyrus 
C, Miller, George McAneny,. Lewis 
H. Pounds, Robert E. Simon, Mar- 
tin Saxe and Oswald Garrison Vil- 
lard. 








Tammany Not Alarmed. 


Tammany men expressed confi- 
dence yesterday that Mr. Roosevelt 
would keep hands off the city situa- 
tion, and that even if he did not, 
Tammany could easily win in any 
Democratic primary. Friends of Mr. 
Roosevelt remarked only that it was 
far too early to predict how he 
would deal with the organization that 
first opposed him bitterly and then 
helped gtve-him a large plurality in 
the city. The tendency among vet- 
erana in city politics yesterday was 
to regard the picking of Acting 
Mayor Joseph V. McKee as a fusion 
candidate now or the selection of 
any one else, with the primaries ten 
months away, as premature. 
Endorsement of Mr. McKee as the 
fusion candidate noxt Fall came yes- 
terday from Frederick J. H. Kracke, 
Republican leader of Kings County. 
Samue: S. Koenig, New York County 
leader, has already endorsed Mr. Mc- 
Kee, and Warren B. Ashmead of 


Queens has approved.

ready weeks ago to make Mr. Mc-

WASHINGTON, Nov. 18.—Bowing 
to the mandate of his State, Senator 
Vandenberg of Michigan today joined 
those demanding immediate resub- 
mission of the Eighteenth Amend- 
ment and Immediate modification of 
the Volstend act. 

The Senator sald he considered the 
two-to-one vote of Michigan citizens 
against their own prohibition act 
“an undeniable mandate’ which 
should be “‘valldated at once.” 

“The vote repealing State prohibi- 
tion In Michigan demonstrates that 
two out of three voters demand a 
change," Senator Vandenberg sald. 
“These emphatic totals came from 
more than a majority of counties in 
all parts of the Commonwealth, The 
result ‘s an undeniable mand: 
For two reasons it should be vali- 
éated at once: 

“Firat, citizens who have spoken 
#0 convincingly are entitled os a 
right of popular government to the 
earliest opportunity to complete their 
conception of ordered temperance. 

Fears Interlude of Chaos, 

“Second, pending this conclusive 
action, there is an interlude of chaos 
which injects new Infirmity into all 
jaw enforcement, precipitates new 
disputes over Federal and State co- 
operation, shatters morale, and en- 
courages lawless and untaxed liquor 
latitudes. I favor immediate resub- 
mission of the Eighteenth Amend 
ment. A just regard for the rights of 
majorities and the validity of law en- 
forcement demands It." 

He added that the “repeal proposal 
should preserve Federal cooperation 
im protecting self-elected dry terri- 
tory from wet invasion.’ 

In conclusion tha Senator sald; 

"I shall not vote to weaken the en- 














forcement of the law as it exists at 


any given time, Whatever the law, 
enforcement is vital, It will be vital 
to any new order, The problem of 
Uquor control is not ended by repeal,

MUNICH, Nov, 18—Whether there 
will soon open a market for German 
beer in United States concerns the 
Bavarian brewery owners less than 
the danger of an exodus of experi- 
enced brewmasters to that country. 

With the export outlook still a masa 
of froth, the heads of some big local 
beer plants serigusly envisage a raid 
on their staffs of trained brewmas- 
ters, it being realized ‘that twelve 
years’ stoppage of production has left 
the United States short of trained 
hop and barley manipulators. 

In such a menace, one 
brewery head sald, there are also in- 
quiries from New York for waitresses 
of the Hofbrau dynasty capable of 
negotiating twelve steins in each 
hand on each trip, as it is foreseen 
that speedy service will be demanded 
once the faucets are again legally 


opened. 
As for early export prospects, the 





Germans Fear Loss of Brewmasters to Us 
And of Waitresses Who Can Carry 24 Steins 





Special Cebie to Tue New Yore Ties. 


Munich and Nuremberg beer kings 
are indulging in no Sllusions, since 
they realize that, in addition to the 
constitutional hurdle, the probable 
duty on beer would make the capture 
of American markets impossible. 
Pre-war exports of beer from Bavaria 
to the United States did not reach 
any appreciable volume, and it ts not 
expected here that future business, 
once the barriers are removed, will 
attain large proportions, 

An American market will be wel- 
comed, of course, but, as one brewer 
observed, ‘‘there seems to be a lot of 
muddled thought on the other side 
with reference to an early resump- 
tion of Bavarian béer exports, judg- 
ing from the inquiries which pour in 
on us from many points in America,” 

This brewer 1s prepared to fill 
orders but warns the cost to the con- 
sumer will be “tall, if the suds ever 
reach their destination,

CHAPTER X 


REDUCED SCALE PHOTOGRAPHIC AND PHOTOLITHOGRAPHIC COPYING ON 
PAPER, FOR READING THROUGH MAGNIFYING GLASSES 


The predominance of area costs in 
the techniques employing the principle of 
photography furnishes a constant temptation 
to reproduce as large a number of words as 
possible on a given area. The ease with 
which an original copy can be reduced in 
size in the course of photographic repro- 
duction increases the temptation, and the 
mathematical law that utilization of area 
increases by squares while reduction of 
linear dimension of the writing proceeds 
arithmetically clinches the economy argu- 
ment in favor of reducing all texts to the 
smallest legible size. 


Thresholds of Legibility 


There are, however, three thres- 
holds of legibility. The first and most 
important is the minimum that can be read 
easily with the naked eye. This minimum 
was placed, in an earlier chapter of the 
book, at seven-point (newsprint) type, or 
pica typescript reduced to 80% of full size. 
Below this minimum there is a range down 
to five-point type, or pica typescript re- 
duced to 70%, within which writing is de- 
‘Cipherable with the naked eye, though not 
easily legible. Within this range a read- 
ing glass will facilitate the reading. When 
still further reduced, writing is inde- 
cipherable with the naked eye, but legible 
with the reading glass or magnifying glass. 
However, as the size of the letters is di- 
minished, a lens system with higher magni- 
fying power than the ordinary reading glass 
is required, and the higher magnifying pow- 
er brings with it a diminution in the field 
of vision. This hampers speed of reading 
and sets a limit to reductions that are to 
be read by direct magnification. Another 
limiting factor is the requirement that 
sufficient light must be reflected from the 
small area of paper that constitutes the 
field of the lens system. Ordinary light 
intensities that would suffice for comfort- 
able reading with the naked eye do not ade- 





quately illuminate the greatly reduced area 
that is to be read with a magnifying glass. 

If seven-point newsprint type is 
taken as the smallest type that can be read 
easily with the naked eye, then a 50% re- 
duction of this type, can be read conven- 
jently with the reading glass but not with 
the naked eye.l Below this level, it is 
possible that more elaborate reading glass 
systems may permit the reading of texts 
that have been copied with higher reduction 
ratios, perhaps as much as eight or ten di- 
ameters from pica typescript. 

Beyond the limit set to reduction 
by these optical devices lies the zone in 
which a projector will yield a legible 
image. Applications of the projection sys- 
tem will be discussed in the next chapter. 

The different zones in which these 
three methods--naked eye reading, reading 
glass reading, and projection reading--are 
operative can be charted as shown in Table 
XXXVII on the following page. 


Reduced Size Newspapers 


There have been several practical 
efforts to utilize these reductions in the 
reading glass zone. The Joint Committee 
codOperated with the New York Times in an 
inquiry addressed to librarians as_ to 
whether they would prefer, for permanent 
preservation, the full-size rag paper copy 
of the Times or a rag paper copy reduced 
one diameter by the photo-offset process. 
A majority of the subscribers to the rag 
paper edition expressed a preference for 
the small size copy because the advantages 
in storing and handling were deemed suffi- 
cient to compensate for the disadvantage 
in reading. A copy of a page of the Times 
reduced to this scale is shown. But the 
response was not sufficient to warrant the 
company in shifting from the present rag 
paper edition to the reduced size edition. 
It appeared that, because of the additional 
expense, the company could find it possible

to make this shift only if a number of sub- 
scribers substantially greater than those 
now taking the rag paper edition would de- 
sire the reduced size edition. 

Another plan for publishing news- 
papers in reduced size has been the subject 
of an experiment by the Millar Publishing 
Company, and has been tied in with the de- 
velopment of an interesting reading device 
manufactured by the Bausch and Lomb Com- 
pany. This direct reading device consists 
of ailens, set ina frame, with a curved 
segment of a cylinder of optical glass 
mounted about two inches above it, and the 
whole system set on a swinging arm, made

magnifying purposes. The magnification in 
this system amounts to about three diameters. 
The newsprint is reduced to approximately 
33% of normal size. Experiments in the of- 
fice of the Joint Committee indicate that 
this device is convenient and practical. 


Miniature Abstracts and Theses 
Another plan for utilizing these 
low reductions has been put into effect by 
Professor Charles C. Peters of the Pennsyl- 
vania State College in reproducing ab- 
stracts of theses of the Department of 


Peters!

REDUCED SCALE PHOTOGRAPHIC AND PHOTOLITHOGRAPHIC COPYING ON PAPER 


Education. A sample page of his work is 
shown. On one side of a page, an abstract 
of the thesis appears in pica typescript 
reduced to about 60% of full size; on the 
other side of the page a longer abstract of 
the thesis is reproduced in a reduction of 
90%-95% of normal size. The cost of pub- 
lishing theses in this format has proven to 
be very low. Three volumes of abstract 
theses, filling 854 typescript pages, and 
containing 300,000 words were published at 
a cost of $300.00. The cost of reproducing 
in reduced size 600 copies of an eighty- 
page set of abstracts was $107.00 in 1933. 
Two hundred and fifty copies were bound by 
the Spiral Binding Company for $.05 per 


copy, making a total cost of $120.00. In 


(1934, the cost of 700 copies was $127.00. 


For reading the miniature print, 
Dr. Peters found after experimentation 
that a stereoscope, with the lenses re- 
versed and with an adapted slide, was most 
convenient for prolonged reading. Dr. Peters 
sells this adapted stereoscope for approxi- 
mately $3.00. He also recommends an elec- 
tric illuminated reading glass device, mag- 
nifying from two to four diameters and 
selling for about $7.50. A third reading 
apparatus which he suggests is the Clerevu 
Table Magnifier, with a 6" lens on an ad- 
justable stand. This device, magnifying 
two to four diameters, sells for $12.00. 

Besides the abstracts, some of the 
doctoral dissertations of the department 
have been published in substantially the 
Same manner. But in the case of doctoral 
dissertations, a nine- or ten-page abstract 
at the 40% reduction is given first, and 
then the whole dissertation follows in 
miniatured pages at the 90% reduction. These 
dissertations include about 100 pages of 
typewritten material each and average about 
65,000 words per thesis. The cost of dis- 
sertations published in this manner is 
$50.00 for 500 copies, including assembling 
and binding, but not including cost of pre- 
paring the manuscript. 


Fiske Method 
Reference has already been made to 


the publication of the Covarrubias Tesoro 


de la Lengua Castellana o Espanola in re- 


duced size for reading with a magnifying 


lens. This publication was related to the 
development sponsored by Admiral Bradley A. 
Fiske, who has developed a hand reading 





Li? 


lens equipment that develops higher magni- 
fications than those available with an or- 
dinary reading glass. In its most recent 
form, the Fiskoscope is a small binocular 
lens equipment set in a frame which can be 
held to the eye like a lorgnette. The 
frame holds a long strip of paper which can 
be moved up or down by rotating a ratchet. 
The text is typewritten with short lines 

so that about 150 words of typescript are 
laid on a page, double spaced. This page 
is then reduced seven diameters. The field 
of vision of the Fiskoscope covers this 
small page; there is, therefore, no diffi- 
culty about skimming. But the difficulties 
of skimming might be expected to appear if 
book pages containing 450 words should be 
copied; and a number of persons who have 
tried reading with the device complain that 
it fatigues their eyes. This may be the 
result of habit, for microscope workers 
train themselves to use without fatigue 
lenses of higher magnifying power. A re- 
production of a strip of Fiskoscope reading 
matter (Figure LVII) and a picture of a 
Fiskoscope (Figure LVI) are printed here- 
with. 

The price of reproductions suited 
to this apparatus is certainly attractive. 
In the American Printer of January, 19382, 
there is an article stating that Fiske 
books of 100,000 words can be printed on 
two strips of paper at a cost of $.05. Each 
strip of paper is 2 5/8" wide and 23 1/2" 
long, including margins. The typescript is 
reduced to 1/25 of original size, and is 
printed on both sides of the strip of pa- 
per. Admiral Fiske secured a quotation of 
$557.00 for an edition of 10,000 books of 
100,000 words, printed on a good quality 
paper. 


Filmstat Reproduction 
The New York Times, Peters, and 


Fiskoscope enterprises have all involved a 
use of the reduced copy methods as an al- 
ternative to publication. A different 
class of use is suggested by the experi- 
ments of Mr. Atherton Seidell of the U. S. 
Public Health Service, by Dr. L. Bendikson 
of the Huntington Library at San Marino, 
and by the developments under way in the 
Folmer Graflex Corporation of Rochester, 
New York. 

Mr. Atherton Seidell, who has been 
active in promoting what he calls "filmstat"

reproduction, counts on reducing book pages 
about ten diameters and reading them by 
several methods. A special magnifier, to 
be manufactured by the Spencer Lens Company, 
will be sold for $5.00 including the handle 
and an eye shade for the eye not used. A 
picture of it is shown. The stand that can

scope is manufactured by E. Leitz, Inc. 
(code word, BSM-B). The image produced by 
this apparatus is a true one, not inverted 
or reversed. Dr. Bendikson uses three dif- 
ferent pairs of oculars with this micro- 
scope: a-5, with an enlargement power of 
3.5, a-10, with magnification of 73 and

be used with the device will sell for about 
$3.00. This system will give about eight 
diameters of magnification. An alternative 
projector device, to cost about $50.00, 
suitable for reading filmstats, will be de- 
scribed in a later chapter on projection 
apparatus. 


Bendikson Procedure 

Dr. Bendikson uses a Leica camera 
to take photographs of pages on the ordi- 
nary moving picture film, with exposures 
about 1" x 11/4". Then he lays down a few 
rows of these film copies side by side in a 
printing frame and makes from them a posi- 
tive copy on paper, exactly as if he were 
making a print from any negative. A repro- 
duction of ione of Dr. Bendikconl ss pramtsmerss 
included herewith. 

For reading these prints, he uses a 
low-power binocular microscope. This micro- 


a=5)) which can enlarge Ons ya. Lie men) 
oculars, which Dr. Bendikson generally uses, 
with a magnifying power of seven diameters, 
will bring back to normal size a page of an 
ordinary octavo book that has been reduced 
to the width of the moving picture film. 

The writer has no experience with 
the optical system used by Dr. Bendikson, 
and cannot estimate how it compares from 
the standpoint of eyestrain with the Fisko- 
scope. It must be noted that any and all 
pages reproduced by this method are reduced ~ 
to the same width, namely, one inch, the 
width of the available surface of the mov- 
INE PUCLURe Sips. 


Van Iterson Device 

Professor G. van Iterson, of the 
Technicals Univiersuty. ace DeliG.. Holslancimmarc 
invented a reading device for microprints.

REDUCED SCALE PHOTOGRAPHIC AND PHOTOLITHOGRAPHIC COPYING ON PAPER 


The apparatus was designed primarily for 
use with 5" x 7" micro-prints, each print 
containing eighteen pages of letterpress 
material. Dr. Bendikson, who went into the 
question of film copying with Professor 
van Iterson when the latter was in Cali- 
fornia several years ago, has very kindly 
given the writer an explanatory descrip- 
tion of the device. Attached to a desklike 
structure is a bracket, which holds a ring 
illuminator with five small lamps that sur- 
round a plano-convex lens. On top of this 
drum-shaped illuminator is a second magni- 
fier. The micro-print is slipped in a 
pressure frame, which slides under the il- 
luminator-magnifier. 





FIGURE LXI 


Van Iterson's device 


Folmer Graflex Recording Camera 
The Folmer Graflex Corporation has 


developed a recording camera that is used 
to take photographs of meter readings on a 
ScrtpeOtepaper. §lt 12s now adapting this 
camera to the general work of record copy- 
ing. The width of the photographic strip 
irethis camera is 21/4", That is to say, 
it would reduce an 8" sheet of typescript 
a little less than four diameters, and 
copy a column of newsprint full size. Ob- 
viously, the miniature copies made with 
this camera will fall in that zone where 
naked eye reading is beginning to be dif- 
ficult and reading glass reading is still 
easy. If the camera is developed, as it 
will probably be, to take a long roll of 
paper, the cost of photographic materials 
per page copied will be somewhere in the 
neighborhood of one-third to one-half cent 
a page. This Graflex copying camera, tak- 
ing pictures directly on paper, will prob- 





LS 


ably offer the individual scholar one of 
the most convenient devices for note tak- 
ing. Since paper costs less than film, the 
scholar can have a much larger copy of his 
pages for a slightly larger material cost, 
and this increase in size may be just suf- 
ficient to render the copy legible with 
the naked eye, or with an ordinary cheap 
reading glass. It is to be hoped that 
equipment of this kind may become available 
to American scholars at a price not great- 
ly in excess of the price of typewriting 
equipment. 

Another principle that could be 
used in copying for reading through magni- 
fying glass systems is the principle of 
the multiple exposure machine. If the 
Folmer Graflex multiple exposure camera 
were adapted for document copying, it would 
permit the division of a 5" x 7" sheet of 
paper of film into any number of subdivi- 
sions, giving the user the chance to find 
that degree of reduction that best suits 
him from the standpoint of economy of ma- 
terials on the one hand and prevention of 
eyestrain on the other. 

If a new positive photocopying pa- 
per appears, as was suggested in the pre- 
ceding chapters, it would be useful in the 
preparation of these reduced-size copies 
on paper. Reduced-size copying on photo- 
stat paper is always a possible alterna- 
tive to reduced-size copying on film, To 
the extent that the use of a film copy neg- 
ative introduces labor-saving features in 
the making of paper copies, the effect is 
to bring the costs of paper copies nearer 
to the bare cost of materials, and hence 
to emphasize and increase the economies 
that will result for high reduction ratios 
on paper. For the more the factor of ma- 
terial costs predominates, the greater is 
the cost advantage in carrying reductions 
to the furthest practical extreme. 


Tru-Vue Apparatus 

Reduced scale photography can 
handle pictures as well as texts. The fact 
that a picture must be seen as a whole 
makes it necessary that the field of view 
of any optical system used for viewing re- 
duced-size pictures should be large, and 
this is the sticking point in the develop- 
ment of viewing apparatus that enlarges 
more than two or three diameters.

COST LEVELS AND APPLICATIONS OF MICROCOPYING AND PROJECTION READING 


There is a final limit beyond 
which the principle of reducing the size 
of the reading matter cannot be carried. 
This limit is reached in "filmslide" or 
microcopying. The name "filmslide" or 
"filmstat" has come to be applied to a 
process of copying on film and reading by 
projection. The word "microcopying" would 


. be more appropriate if glass should come 


in as a photographic material.

grain on a photographic emulsion.+ The 
dark portions of a photograph are made up 
of clots of small particles of metallic 
silver embedded in dry gelatin. The rela-— 
tion between the size of these grains and 
the possible extent of photographic reduc- 
tion of reading matter can be graphically 
illustrated if one imagines that he has 
before him a level table top and a few 
handfuls of sand, and wants to form let- 
ters on the table top by laying down lines 
of loose sand. If the sand is very fine- 
grained, like powder, he will be able to 
make smaller letters than if the sand is 
coarse-grained or gravelly. But no matter 
how fine the sand there will be a limit, a 
size of letter, in which the grains from 
the different strokes of the writing will 
run together, the hollows inside the "d's" 
and the "e's" fill up. Letters the size 
of these printed on this page could not be 


1. Mr. Verneur Pratt, of International Filmbook Corporation, comments on this statement: 
ion, the size of the grain in the original emulsion is not the technological limit. 
the present process positive film, either of Eastman, DuPont, Gaevert, or others, is sufficiently 
fine to permit of reductions up to fifty diameters....Our experience is that the reason the develop- 
ing laboratories cannot secure clean-cut and distinct letters at high ratios of minification is found 


within the process itself... 





formed from loose sand on a table top, no 
matter how much care were used. The cor- 
responding limit is found in reducing news- 
print on photographic film. When the re- 
duction is carried below twenty diameters, 
the letters begin to blur over; at twenty- 
five diameters the blurring is very notice- 
able; at thirty-six diameters, if the great- 
est care is used, the words are still suf- 
ficiently formed to permit faintly legible 
enlargements to be made. Beyond that, ev-—- 
erything runs together. 




















Reduction Ratio in Copying 
The limit set by the grain of the 


film to the possibility of making photo- 
graphic reductions of reading matter can 
be called the "resolving power" of the 
film. The standard scientific measure for 
resolving power is in lines per millimeter, 
but this proves to be too refined a meas-— 
urement for studying the practical useful- 
ness of apparatus on the market under nor- 
mal working or library conditions. Since 
the final term in the whole process is a 
legible projected image, a rough index of 
the legibility of the product can be used 
to make a comparison of films, cameras and 
treatments of film. Again the newsprint 
can be taken as a standard, and the effi- 
ciency of a microcopying process or materi- 
al can be stated in terms of_the number of 
diameters of reduction of 7-point news- 
print; this number will be called the "re-

We believe that 


Our contention is that the individual grains are quite small enough for

ing technique that has become a lost art because of the lack of demand for its perfection.

for 7-point newsprint is sixteen diame- 
ters, the same material and process should 
copy 14-point type with approximately 
equal efficiency at a reduction of 25 to 
52 diameters. Note, though, that four-— 
teen-point type is not necessarily twice 
the size of a 7—point face. 

Many conditions of a page other 
than the point size of the type will extend 
or limit the possible reduction ratio. The 
body of type (whether heavy or light), the 
spacing of the letters on the line, the 
whiteness of the paper, the blackness of 
the ink, the clearness of the edges of the 
letters--all these things will control the 
resolving power of a photographic emulsion 
as applied to the microcopying of a par- 
ticular page. For every page, however, 
there is some differential which, for mi- 
crophotographic purposes, will equate it 
with newsprint. Some specific handicap in 
reduction ratio can be allotted, either to 
the newsprint or the other page, so that 
newsprint reduced by x diameters is the 
microphotographic equivalent of the other 
page reduced y diameters. The reduction 
ratio is a quantity of fundamental impor- 
tance governing all cost calculations in 
film copying. What is the highest prac-— 
ticable reduction ratio? 

The limit of the reduction ratio 
in microcopying is set by three factors: 
the resolving power of the emulsion on the 
film or glass; the resolving power of the 
lens and the mechanical perfection of the 
camera; and the workmanship in focusing, 
lighting, timing the exposure, and devel- 
oping the image. 


Process—Positive Emulsion 

The most widely used photographic 
emulsion for microcopying is the one that 
happens to be the cheapest--the "process 
positive" emulsion used in making positive 
prints in moving picture work, or in pho- 
togravure. This emulsion is manufactured 
to respond to the blacks and whites of a 
photographic negative, and is therefore 
well adapted to render the contrast of 
black and white in copying. 

For a copying problem in which 
faded ink or stained or colored paper is 
. involved, a panchromatic emulsion would be 
preferable. The emulsion used by the Rec- 
ordak Corporation for microcopying is de- 
vised to take care of a wide variety of 








METHODS OF REPRODUCING RESEARCH MATERIALS 


color contrasts. While not specifically a 
panchromatic film, it is yet more recep-— 
tive to color contrasts than ordinary proc-— 
ess positive emulsion. DuPont quarter- 
speed pan or Eastman micro-pan is recom-— 
mended for work involving color. 

There is every prospect that finer 
emulsions will become available, or that 
special processing may render the present 
emulsions capable of higher reduction ra— 
tios than they now accept in copying. But 
it remains to be seen whether the prices 
of these special emulsions or processings 
will be sufficiently close to the price of 
process positive film to make them a de- 
sirable substitute. In this chapter, ex— 
cept when otherwise stated, the kind of 
photographic emulsion under discussion is 
the process positive. 


Camera and Lens System 

The efficiency of a camera and 
lens system in affecting the reduction ra- 
tio is a product com three™ facvorscm mune 
quality of the lens itself; the adaptation 
of the mechanism for accurate focusing; 
and the success of the film-—holding mechan- 
ism in preventing a slight buckling of the 
film. All copying cameras save one hold 
the document still and make exposures one 
at a time through a lens which covers the 
whole film area on which the page is cop- 
ied. The Recordak apparatus uses a differ- 
ent principle: the documents are copied 
while in motion. The light passes through 
a slit to the moving film, and falls in a 
narrow band across the film. This optical 
system is said to simplify the elimination 
of distortion near the edges of the film. 

It is not easy to isolate these 
factors in appraising the efficiency of a 
camera and lens system, but the writer, 
after some experimentation with a number 
of cameras, has come to the conclusion 
that, taking all factors into account, it 
seems perfectly safe to regard eighteen 
diameters reduction of newsprint as well 
within the capacity of most film, appara- 
tus, and workmanship. Eighteen diameters 
reduction of newsprint should be substan- 
tially equivalent to thirty-six diameters 
reduction of fourteen-point type. 


Limits of Reduction Ratio q 


As an ultimate limit, a reduction 
of twenty-five diameters of newsprint might

conceivably become practical, but at such 
great reductions another consideration 
would have to be taken into account; name- 
ty; the amount) of light that can be forced 
through a translucent film covered with 
dry gelatin emulsion without damaging it 
by overheating. 

The Eastman Company, in developing 
its Recordak copying machines for docu- 
ments and newspapers, has allowed a certain 
margin of safety by setting sixteen diame- 
fel soiombeereductLon ratio. Lt also has 
a document copying machine set to make re- 
ductions of seventeen, eighteen and four- 
tenths, and twenty-three diameters. The 
choice of certain of these ratios was prob- 
ably the consequence, not so much of lim-— 
itations of resolving power as of conven- 
ience in that ordinary business documents 
are 8" wide and will go easily on 16m. 
film if reduced seventeen diameters; while 
the newspapers are 18" wide, and will go 
eveniy on a 35mm. film (perforated on one 
side only) at the reduction ratio sixteen. 
The twenty-three diameter reduction is sat- 
isfactory for typescript and will put 50% 
more typescript on a foot of film than 
seventeen diameter reduction will put on. 

In comparing the work of different 
cameras, an arbitrary scale of legibility

D Legibility: Almost illegible. The

etc., are blotted solid. Separate

E Legibility: Absolute illegibility. 


Then seven film copying devices 
(these devices will be described in the 
next chapter) were tested, allowance being 
made in some cases for better and poorer 
runs, or for expert and amateur workman- 
ship. The difference between the worst 
and the best workmanship was much greater 
than the difference between the worst and 
the best apparatus. The conclusions of the 
experiment can be summarized on the follow-— 
ing table. 

Another way of demonstrating the 
limits of resolving power is to microcopy 
a page and then enlarge it back to its 
original size. The loss of legibility suf- 
fered by the reducing and enlarging process 
will then show itself. 

In the following exhibits, type- 
script and newsprint have been carried by 
various cameras to varying degrees of re- 
duction and enlarged back to original size. 
These exhibits require careful explanation. 
The most instructive one is that prepared 
by Dr. L. Bendikson and Mr. E. F. Morkisch

California (Figure LXIIb). 

Dr. Bendikson was furnished with a 
page (Figure LXIIa) upon which four clip- 
pings were pasted, and he was asked to re- 
duce this page by 16 diameters with his 
Leica camera and then enlarge it back to 
original size. ‘But, as cam be seen, two 
of the clippings were already reduced 50% 
from original size by photo-offset. Dr. 
Bendikson was asked to enlarge these re- 
duced clippings back to twice the size in 
which they came to him. The enlargements 
are here reproduced as Figure LXIIb. At 
the top of the page are the two clippings, 
one of newsprint and the other of type- 
script, which have been passed through a 
reduction of 16 diameters; at the bottom 
GL uae page are the two clippings, valsover

pearance of newsprint in this reduction 
can be noted in Figure LIV, a page of 
the New York Times reduced 50% by photo-

4. The photo-offset copies of the two 

clippings were then photographed on 

film in an additional reduction of 16 

diameters, making a total reduction of 

42 diameters from original size. 

The two clippings were then enlarged 

back 32 diameters on bromide paper. 

6. The bromide paper was then photographed

One of the most extraordinary uses 
of microcopying, and seemingly one of the 
most efficient in the history of photog-— 
raphy, was the work of Monsieur Dagron dur- 
ing the siege of Paris in 1870. Dagron's 
postal service into the beleagured city 
was set up to use carrier pigeons. To in- 
crease the number of words a pigeon could 
carry, messages were printed on a large 
sheet of paper and microphotographed on 
film. The film was then inserted in a 
quill and carried by the pigeon. A piece

fragment printed herewith is an enlarge- 
ment of S52 diameters from the film. The 
exact size of the film, which contains 
eleven pages of three columns each, is al- 
so shown. There is no direct evidence to 
establish the size of the print from which 
the microphotograph was made, but by count- 
ing the letters in a line, and the number 
Qumcolumms per inch, it is possible to es— 
timate that the vertical dimensions of the 
original typography must have been about

the same as modern newsprint, and the hor- 
izontal dimension somewhat smaller. The 
reduction from which this enlargement was 
made must have been the equivalent of some- 
thing between 32 and 39 diameters from 
newsprint. 


Cost of Photosensitive Surface 

The cost of the photographic sur- 
face used in microcopying varies between 
#.14 and $.50 per square foot. The cheap- 
est film is the motion picture nitrate 
film which sells for $.01 a rumning foot, 
45mm. wide; but this is, or ought to be, 
excluded from consideration. No nitrate 
film should ever be used for copying work, 
for the cellulose nitrate upon which the 
emulsion is spread is highly unstable in 
the presence of heat. In its chemical com- 
position it is a half-finished high explo- 
Sive, like a dynamite stopped halfway in 
the course of manufacture. It cannot be 
preserved with safety except in expensive 
vaults and it always brings a fire risk

The so-called "safety film" or 
cellulose acetate has a fire resistance 
about the same as that. of paper of similar 
density. Hold a match to a sheet of dry 
cellulose acetate and it will crumble but 
iG will not sustain a flame. Tt has high 
stability-—-Mr. B. W. Scribner of the Bu- 
reau of Standards has stated--equal to the 
best-made papers. Safety film is sold or- 
dinarily at $.015 a running foot in the 
65mm. width. It can sometimes be pur- 
chased from firms dealing in odd lengths 
for a lower price, but the $.015 is stand- 
ard, whether for perforated or unperforated

1 1/8" out of the 35mm. are usable, and 
this makes the usable surface cost $.1605

with 1 1/4" usable, the price per square 
foot comes to #.144.

price of a usable square foot (28 linear

the lowest. The 7Omm. film, perforated on 
both sides, is supplied on special order

A slightly different emulsion with 
a different weight of supporting film is

work and sold by a different method. Be- 
cause of these differences, the process

price. A dozen sheets, 5" x 7", retail

in this form costs $.50 per square foot in 
small quantities, $.325 per square foot in 
large quantities. The same emulsion on 
glass is sold for the same price in the 
same size. 

The tabulation of these figures 
indicates the price range of translucent 
photographic surfaces, whether in the form 
of film or glass, of rectangles or long 
strips: 





Film or Glass Versus Paper 
Why is it desirable to use a trans-— 


lucent medium in copying? One part of the 
answer to this question is found in the be- 
havior of light. In discussing the possi- 
bilities of reading reduced-size print by 
means of a reading glass, it was stated 
that a "direct" optical system can be used 
in raising the ostensible size of the let- 
ters one diameter, but that it soor. comes 
to call for more intensive light on the 
surface of the paper than would be required 
if no magnifying were done. The same prin- 
ciple, pressed one degree further, will 
permit a legible image of a page to be pro- 
jected from a paper copy by reflection in 

a projection lantern if sufficient light 

is focused on the paper. As the enlarging 
ratio increases, it approaches and reaches 
the point where the surface of the paper 
will not reflect sufficient light to make 
the projected image legible. At this

IES USE OLSi6eMM&gt; FILM IN LIBRARY WORK 


In the past year, considerable progress has been made in equipment and 
technique for copying various records on film. The technique of micro-copying, 
combined with the use of WPA labor, opens a new field for achievement of large- 


scale objectives, hitherto abandoned as too expensive for the average institution. 


The Recordak Corporation, of 350 Madison Avenue, New York City, 
using regular commercial equipment and specially developed equipment has done 
considerable work along this line. Sometime ago, Recordak equipment was used 
to photograph the NRA and AAA hearings in Washington on 16mm. film. Posi- 


tive copies of this film record were sold to libraries throughout the country. 


Recently, Dr. T. R. Schellenberg and others, with the cooperation of the 
Recordak Corporation, worked out a plan for the photographing of library cards. 
The general procedure as planned involves the filming of the catalogues of all the 
libraries in a region, and the typing of library cards from the film copies to make a 
master catalogue. For the reading of the film, the typists use Recordak projectors, 


which enlarge the film copies to original size. 


For $5.50 worth of film (200 feet), including developing, 10,000 library 
catalogue cards can be copied. The plan is ideal, as cards can be photographed at 
a high rate of speed with absolute accuracy, minimum disturbance of library 
routine, simplicity of operation, and at a lower cost than could possibly be 
attained with any other method. Two large centers, Cleveland and Philadelphia, 


are pioneering in this field by making union catalogues of their library holdings. 


The attached film contains pictures of a number of standard library cards. 














PRESERVATION OF NEWSPAPERS 
BY PHOTOGRAPHY 


(Reprinted, by permission, from 
Bulletin of American Newspaper 


Publishers Association) 


By W. E. WINES, 
Manager Mechanical Department 


A photographic method and apparatus for reproducing newspaper pages 
in reduced size, so that newspaper files may consist of small reels of negative film 
instead of bulky bound volumes, has been announced by Eastman Kodak Company 
and was exhibited in New York by Charles Z. Case. This is a development of the 
Recordak system which has been in use for eight years by banks and mercantile 
companies for making photographic records of checks and bills. The process 
consists of two steps or stages. The pages of any issue are first photographed con- 
secutively on a sensitized film 13 inches wide, by means of a special camera which 
photographs the pages with great rapidity—approximately 30 pages a minute. For 
viewing the film, a special projector or viewing apparatus has been devised which 
produces an image the linear dimensions of which are 14 times those of the 
original printed page. A column 2 inches wide is enlarged by the projector to 
3 inches and the height of the letters is magnified in the same ratio. 


THE FILM. 


The film used is similar to the standard 35-mm. film used in professional 
moving picture cameras but differs in two important particulars. The first is 
that the base which carries the sensitive emulsion is the non-inflammable cellulose 
acetate, used in amateur movie cameras, instead of the highly combustible cellulose 
nitrate, commonly used for professional moving picture work. Mr. Case says that 
the National Board of Fire Underwriters rates this “safety” film as offering no 
more fire hazard than the same quantity and form of newsprint. The second

Briefly stated, the outstanding advantages 
of this method are: 


A tremendous reduction in space required to 
house newspaper files. The film record requires 
less than 2% of the storage space required by 
the original bound volumes. 


The film record is a much more permanent one 
than the present bound volumes. This record 
can be renewed as deSired thus preserving the 
files indefinitely. 


The files can be referred to much more easily 
with the new method. They can be retained 
where they are immediately available and the 
moving about of large bound volumes is 
eliminated. 


The cost is exceedingly small = being only 
1-1/5¢ per page for standard size newspaper 
pages. Consequently 1,000 pages will cost 
only $12.00 which is little more than the 
present binding cost. 


RECORDAK CORPORATION 








difference is that this film is perforated on only one edge, thus allowing more 
usable area on the same total width. One foot of film negative carries eight and 
a fraction newspaper pages or approximately 825 to 850 pages on 100 feet of 
film. The pages are arranged lengthwise on the film. 


THE CAMERA. 


The camera, which might more properly be called a photographing machine, 
is almost wholly automatic in action. The newspapers to be photographed are 
fed in one page at a time, very much as sheets are fed into a cylinder press or 
mimeograph. Since the photographing of an entire month’s edition will require 
only thirty minutes, more or less, it would hardly pay any newspaper to purchase 
one of these cameras. Newspaper publishers ship the month’s file of newspapers to 
Rochester each month and pay for the negative film at a price of 10 cents per foot. 
If more than one film is desired from the same lot of papers, duplicates are made 
at a cost of 5 cents per foot. These prices cover the film itself as well as the items 
of exposure and development. This charge for the first negative is equivalent to 
11/4, cents per page, and for the positive duplicate copies, 7, of a cent per page. 

A reel of one hundred feet of film occupies a storage space 159x334x334 
inches and carries at least 850 newspaper pages. When asked concerning the life 
of the film, Mr. Case replied that no one really knows how long a negative film 
will last, as none has yet become useless from age. It may last 100 years or 
more. As it is a comparatively simple and inexpensive matter to duplicate the film 
at any time, the length of life of film is not really a vital matter. Mr. Case also 
stated that bound volumes of old issues can be reproduced and preserved by this 
method, but that to do so it would be necessary to take the volumes apart. 


THE PROJECTOR. 


The projector or viewing device is shown in the accompanying illustration. 
The base measures approximately 15 by 18 inches, and the total height is a 
little over 3 feet. The reel of film is mounted on a carrier on top of the apparatus, 
as shown, and is unwound and rewound as desired by means of a crank mounted 
on the right side of the casing, as is shown in the illustration. Since the pages are 
atranged in consecutive order on the film, any page desired may be easily and 
quickly located. The projector shows both 16 and 35 mm. film, 


In the base of the projector is a roll of dull surfaced paper 15 inches wide. 
The free end of this roll is pulled over the base and forms the screen upon which 
the film pictures are projected. As the surface becomes soiled a clean section is 
pulled down and the soiled portion is torn off. The screen shows one-quarter of 
a newspaper page at a time. 

It will be noticed from the illustration that four columns of an 8-column 
page are visible. The knob and lever mounted on the left side of the case are 
employed for shifting the film, carrier and optical system forward or backward or 
to right or left so as to bring into the field of view the exact portion of the page 
which the operator desires to read. Records photographed on 16 mm. film appear 
in their entirety on the screen. The source of light is a 200-watt lamp protected 
by a guard as shown. The apparatus is designed to prevent injury to the film by 
heat, no matter how long the film may be exposed to the light of the lamp. The 
cabinet protects the image on the screen from interference by extraneous light 
sources, thus allowing the projector to be used in any room under normal lighting 
conditions. 


If a copy of any particular article or story is desired, this can be obtained 
photographically by laying a piece of photographic paper on the screen so that 
the sensitized surface receives the image. If a print of a whole page is desired, 
this may be made from the negative by the process commonly employed for making 
enlarged photographic prints. The price of the projector is $185.00. 

Newspapers in various parts of the country are now photographing their 
editions by the Recordak method and are using Recordak Library Projectors for 
reading the film. Several libraries are now using film copies of newspapers that 
they ordinarily kept on their shelves in bound form. The use of film copies 
materially reduces the space required to house the bound volumes, eliminates the 


698 


cost of binding and provides a permanent record. These libraries are using 
Recordak Library Projectors for reading from the films. 


Recently the Recordak Corporation photographed the editions of the New 
York Times from January 1, 1914, to December 31, 1918. Positive copies of this 
New York Times film for the 5 years of the World War have been ordered by a 
number of libraries. The cost of the film copies for the entire 5 years is $433.74. 
Individual years may be purchased if desired.

COST LEVELS AND APPLICATIONS OF MICROCOPYING AND PROJECTION READING 


possible reduced-scale copying methods 
from the standpoint of costs of surface 
can be established if we consider the cost 
of copying 256 square feet of printed mat- 
ter (the equivalent of 93. pages of the 
New York Times, or of an octavo book of 
approximately 300 pages). It is evident 
that this amount of printed matter can be 
copied at different reduction ratios on 
areas of photographic surface at the fol- 
lowing costs: 


127 


Reading apparatus for paper in re- 
ductions of 6 to 8 diameters has not 
been developed as far as that for film in 
reductions of 16 diameters; there is no 
reading apparatus at all for glass, and 
reading machines for film positives made 
from rectangular glass plates with multiple 
exposures have not yet been brought to per- 
fection in design. Storage and filing of 
paper in short items may prove less costly 
than storage and filing of film; glass

DUCTION RATIOS

Price of photostat

It is worth noting that the lower 
threshold for reading glass legibility, 
set in the preceding chapter at 7 di- 
ameters reduction from typescript, would 
permit the copying of this 256 square feet 
of paper on 5.2 square feet of photo- 
graphic surface, the price of which would 
be $.23. If the photostatic reduction on 
paper were to be four diameters, the price 
of the paper would be $.72; a reduction of 
two diameters (i.e., to one-half normal 
size) would require photostat paper cost- 
ing $2.88. 

These figures indicate a very in- 
teresting problem in planning the use of 
photography in scholarship. The zone 
from 6 to 8% diameters of reduction on 
paper corresponds in materials cost to 
the zone of 11 to 16 diameters on film, 
16 to 22% diameters on glass. Process- 
ing costs under present conditions prob- 
ably give additional advantages to the 
film strips in the case of a long series 
of pages that will fill 100 feet or more 
of film, but this advantage in favor of 
film may be reversed in the case of short 
items, especially when a number of posi- 
tive copies are required.

would probably cause higher storage costs, 
but would have possible advantages in dur- 
ability. The fundamental choice between 
the long strip and the rectangle, between 
paper, film and glass, between the low re- 
duction ratios required by paper and the 
high ratios permitted by glass are not con- 
clusively indicated by the present state of 
technology and experiment. But precisely 
because the use of moving picture film has 
been more highly developed as a quantity 
industry, Jt) is to vmis medium that mostvos 
the experiment and development has been di- 
rected, and consequently it is in terms of 
the use of this medium that the whole prob-— 
lem of microcopying can be best presented 
at this time. 

For that reason the analysis of the 
possibilities of microcopying on the fol- 
lowing pages will assume standard moving 
picture film in the standard widths of 16mn., 
S55mm., and 70mm. as the norm, and treat pa- 
per and glass or rectangular film as pos— 
sible exceptions. 

The Simplified Practice Division of 
the Department of Commerce has asked for an 
agreement by all those promoting microcopy-— 
ing to adapt all apparatus to the 16mm. and 


L283 


45mm. widths. In replying to the Division 
of Simplified Practise recommendation, cir- 
culated in September 1945, the writer, as 
chairman of the Joint Committee on Materi- 
als for Research, made the reservation 
that simplified practice should not ex- 
eludevat this time a size VoL. films thar 
will permit of vertical filing, and coér- 
dinate with the use of paper and glass. 
But for the copying of a long fixed series 
of material, it seemed best to concur in 
this standardization of film width. A 
"long fixed series" is any amount of doc- 
umentation that will require 100 feet or 
more of film for copying, and will not 
call for the insertion of a newly photo- 
graphed item between two items already 
photographed. 


Full Use of Area of Moving Picture Film 
When 16mm., 35mm., or 7Omm. film 
is used for microcopying, one dimension of 
the photographic image is rigidly fixed; 
it cannot exceed the usable width of the 
film, nor can it be less than the width of 
the film without causing a wastage of 
photosensitive surface. The dimension 
along the length of the film is variable 
provided the photographing is done in a 
camera, such as the Filmograph or Recordak, 
which permits the operator to vary the 
amount of film used at each exposure. 
the crosswise dimension is fixed, and 
therefore, attention must be given to the 
placing of the photographic image on the 
film. The same principle of maximum use 
of area that was found operative in photo- 
offset work is applicable to microphotog-—

metal sheet, so it is wasteful to make on 
35mm. film an image only 3/4" wide. 

There are three, or possibly four 
positions in which book pages may be copied 
on moving picture film. The position 
chosen for photographing a book on the full 
width of the film determines the reduction 
ratio. The three positions, hereafter 
called first, second and third, are illus-— 
trated on the following diagram. 

The relation of these book posi- 
tions to the reduction ratios can be illus-— 
trated by calculating the reduction ratio 
of a book 6" x 9" in all three positions 
on the two kinds of film, 55mm. and 16mm. 
The corresponding variation in cost of 
photosensitive surface can be illustrated 
by calculating the footage and price of 
film necessary to copy 100 pages in each of 
the positions and on each of the widths of 
itt lorries 

Verneur Pratt, president of the In— 
ternational Filmbook Corporation, has pro- 
posed that the reading material might be 
arranged in a fourth way-—-the lines of 
print running across the film, making a 
column the full length of the film but 
leaving space on the film for more than 
one column. 

If Mr. Pratt's plan for multiple 
exposures on strips should be applied to 
70mm. film, from Sto le "colimsromon. 
dinary book pages reduced 16 to 20 diame— 
ters could be run on the width of the film. 
There is at present no apparatus for mak-— 
ing photographs in this way, but the price | 
of film for 100 pages can none the less be d 
calculated. A hundred pages would go on f 
4% to 9 linear inches of film, the 
price of which would be $.015 to $.0275.

Processing Costs 

The processing costs for micro-— 
copies are like the costs of the photo- 
graphic surface in that they apply to a 
footage of film strips, or, roughly, an 
area of film. 

There are two kinds of processing 
involved in microcopying: first, the de—- 
veloping and fixing of the negative; and 
second, the making of contact or other 
prints from the negative. If a unique 
copy only of a book or document is desired, 
there is no need for the second process— 
ing. 

The commercial processing of film 
has been organized in two kinds of busi- 
ness enterprise. Short strips of film are 
processed for the amateur photographer by 
services available in every drug store. 
Long runs of moving picture film are proc-— 
essed at prices that may be much less per 


film area than those charged by the ordi- 
nary service. 

The short five-foot strips of film 
used in such cameras as the Leica and Con- 
tax can usually be developed (but not 
printed as positive contact prints) at the 
corner drug store. The charge is usually 
#.15 or $.20--hence $.035 or $.04 a foot. 
One New York specialist in developing the 
five-foot rolls charges $.30 or $.06 a 
foot. Many users of these small micro- 
copying cameras do their own processing. 

Film strips of 100 feet or more in 
length can be processed in the film labor- 
atories serving the moving picture industry. 
Quotations from a number of laboratories, 
analyzed to make allowance for various 
special charges connected with sound track 
printing, establish the following scale:

COST LEVELS AND APPLICATIONS OF MICROCOPYING AND PROJECTION READING 


resort to low processing costs may entail 

a low reduction ratio, and hence the sav- 

ing in processing may be sacrificed by in- 
creasing the material cost. 

Just as in calculating typescript 
book costs it was necessary to assume ar-— 
bitrarily an average typing charge before 
proceeding to further comparative studies, 
so in calculating microcopying costs an ar-— 
bitrary average processing figure will be 
assumed. The difference between the price 
of developing a negative and the price of 
making a positive print from a negative 
will be ignored; it does not appear in 
most quotations. Processing will be fig- 
ured regularly at $.0175 for 16mm., $.025 
for 35mm. film; the joint cost of film and 
processing will stand then at $.025 for 
1é6mm., $.04 for 35mm. film. It is under- 
stood that these prices are available only 
in large footages, running into the thou- 
sands of feet. Maximum figures for short-— 
er runs, when necessary, will be assumed 
at $.03 for 16mm. film, $.05 for 35mm., to 
include film and processing. Very short 
runs of a few inches only introduce a spe- 
cial problem which will be separately anal- 
yzed. 


First Costs and Running Costs in Micro- 
copying 

The application of microcopying to 
the distribution of reading matter is so 
new, the price levels at which it operates 
so revolutionary, that the fundamental ele- 
ments of cost as they appear in publishing 
are not apparent at first glance, and yet 
they are present. In micr&gt;copying, as in 
other techniques, there is the antithesis 
between a cost curve that falls with each 
additional number of copies and a cost 
curve that remains constant regardless of 
the number of copies that are made. In 
other words, there is a first cost and a 
running cost. The first cost includes the 
labor of making a photograph and processing 
the negative film; the running cost is the 
cost of making each additional positive 
from the negative. 

There may arise many situations in 
which there will be no positives made from 
the negative. The original negative will 
be made as a unique copy for a single pur- 
chaser. The cost of this unique copy will 
consist of two elements: first, labor in 
photography; second, film and processing. 





16k 


This situation will be studied first, and 
then its implications traced in those cases 
where a number of positive copies are to be 
made from a single negative for a number of 
purchasers. The cost of making this nega- 
tive stands, however, as a "first cost," 
comparable, for instance, with the cost of 
setting type and fitting it in a press, or 
preparing mimeograph stencils or photo- 
offset metal sheets. It is absolutely in- 
dependent of the number of copies that are 
to be made from the negative. 

How is this cost to be estimated in 
the case of long runs of material? As in 
so many other situations, the most expen- 
sive and specialized apparatus reduces the 
labor cost. The small, non-specialized 
cameras such as the Leica or Contax corre- 
spond to hand-set type in printing, and the 
large, highly-specialized cameras, such as 
the Recordak, Filmograph, Kennedy, and per-— 
haps the new Graflex, correspond to the 
linotype in efficiency. 

Experience in photographing large 
collections of documents has been most amp-— 
ly obtained by the Filmograph Corporation 
and by Lloyd B. Kennedy in copying land ti- 
tle abstract records, and by the Recordak 
Corporation in a variety of copying enter- 
prises. 

Filmograph and Kennedy experiences 
agree in establishing that one operator can 
copy 10,000 pages of bound records per day; 
Dr. T. R. Schellenberg, using a Recordak to 
copy the unbound typescript pages of the 
NRA and AAA hearings, also copied 10,000 
pages a day. In all these cases there was 
material in hundreds of thousands of pages, 
uniform in size, continuous in supply. The 
May Company of Cleveland uses a Recordak to 
copy its internal records. The operators 
photograph 20,000 statements, 7" x 10", per 
day. Speed records with the new Recordak 
bound book copying camera are not available. 
It is safe to conclude that experience with 
uniform and continuous matter, whether 
bound or unbound, permits an estimate of 
10,000 pages a day as a maximum. 

While these automatic machines can 
be operated by relatively unskilled labor, 
Lue Seno vOONmMUCh mE &gt;DONcCOUMGm Lic labor Cost 
at $10.00 per day, which might cover the 
wages of two operators, one to do the pho- 
tographing, the other to bring the material 
to the machine and return it to place. 

This labor cost is independent of 


qe 





the reduction ratio and hence of the amount 
of film used in a given copying job. But 
with the film used at a reduction ratio of 
16 to 23 diameters, and processing costs 
figured at their average for long runs, the 
cost of film and processing should stand 
somewhere near the labor cost—-perhaps 
$10.00 worth of labor will photograph 
$12.00 to $15.00 worth of film (including 
processing). At this rate the first cost 
--i.e., the finished negative—-of micro-— 
copied material in large runs can be made 
for $.22 to $.25 per 100 pages. This is 
the cost at which a unique copy of a great 
body of material could be made for a single 
purchaser. 

But if a number of purchasers 
should wish to acquire the same material, 
the cost of making the positive copies for 
each would be exactly the film—and-process-— 
ing charge for film plus a pro-rata frac- 
tion of the first cost divided among the 
purchasers. The behavior of costs in this 
situation can be illustrated from two cas-— 
es: first, the actual experience of the 
Joint Committee on Materials for Research 
in distributing microcopies of the hearings 
held under the NRA and AAA; and second, the 
estimated costs of a project for copying 
two million pages of books printed in Eng- 
land before 1640--a project that would 
bring to subscribing libraries copies of 
all books listed in Pollard and Redgrave 
Short Title Catalogue. 

The Joint Committee arranged with 
the Agricultural Adjustment Administration 
and the National Recovery Administration to 
make microcopies of the hearings. The to- 
tal number of typescript pages was approxi- 
mately 315,000. The reduction ratio was 
25 diameters. The cost of making the neg— 
ative, including Recordak rental, film and 
film developing was $455.00 for 13,400 feet 
of 16mm. film. The cost of making addi- 
tional positives was $468.50 each. The 
whole project was figured to distribute the 
cost of making the negative among ten sub- 
secribers, making the cost of the micro- 
copies of the 315,000 pages $413.50 or 
$.13 per 100 pages. 

The work of microcopying this great 
body of material was carried to a success— 
ful conclusion by Dr. T. R. Schellenberg, 
in spite of many obstacles. The material 
consisted of unbound typescript pages, some 
of them carbon copies on thin paper, to- 


METHODS OF REPRODUCING RESEARCH MATERIALS 





gether with a number of printed pamphlets. 
When the material was first filmed, the op- 
erative employed to feed the pages skipped 
some of them or fed them into the Recordak 
machine in an irregular way. Moreover, the 
machine itself was not set to take care of 
the photographic differences between light 
and dark copies, or between bond and onion— 
skin paper. When a check up of the first 
film copy of thé NRA records revealed im- 
perfections, an effort was made to correct 
them by cutting the microcopy strips and 
interspersing freshly photographed strips 
of film in the faulty places. But this 
film strip, when used for making positive 
copies, did not prove satisfactory. Dr. 
Schellenberg therefore recopied the whole 
file of NRA hearings, with the technical 
help of members of the staff of the Rec- 
ordak Corporation, which was very generous, 
not only in solving technical difficulties, 
but also in contributing free of charge the 
machine and film for the second copying. In 
calculating and assessing the cost of the 
project, the extra copying operation was 
not taken into account, for it was the re- 
sult of conditions which need not be dupli- 
cated in the future, and is charged off to 
experiment and experience. 

A project to make widely available 
copies of all early printed English books 
has been under discussion among librarians 
for several years, and has led to a number 
of cost calculations. The project differs 
from that of copying the AAA and NRA hear- 
ings, not only in its greater magnitude, 
but also in the greater expense that must 
necessarily be incurred in travel and su- 
pervision, and in setting and resetting the 
camera to take volumes of different sizes 
at different reduction ratios. A memoran- 
dum on cost was drawn up at the office of 
the Joint Committee in September, 1935. 

For purposes of calculation it was assumed 
that the total number of pages would be two 
million, and the average page size an oc- 
tavo in twelve-point type. The calculation 
was made to cover two alternatives in re- 
duction ratio--l2 diameters and 21 di- 
ameters, and the alternative of using 45mm. 
or 16mm. film. The memorandum on cost, 
while rather elaborate, serves to illus— 
trate the behavior of so many of the vari- 
ables in microcopying that it is here 
quoted textually: 

The first cost of making an original

es is hard to calculate and not greatly de- 
pendent on reduction ratio, for so much of 
it will be travel, supervision, apparatus

Other costs are variable with the 
number of feet of film used. On 35mm. film 
in the third position, reduced 12 diame- 
ters, 2,000,000 pages (750,000 linear feet 
of book) would go on approximately 62,500 
feet of film plus 10% for margin, bringing 
the total roughly to 70,000 feet. On 16mm. 
film in second position, reduced 21 diam- 
eters, 2,000,000 pages (1,000,000 feet of 
book) would go on 48,000 feet of film plus 
10% for margin, bringing the total to 
56,000 feet. The cost for the film and the 
processing for 55mm. film, if figured at 
$.04 a foot, is $2,800; for the 16mm. filn, 
mipuredsat $.025 a foot, it is $1,325. 

Resuming our calculations, the dif- 
ference in reduction ratio and film cost 
becomes increasingly important as the num- 
ber of subscribing libraries increases. The 
possibility will also appear that very sub- 
stantial reductions in the processing cost 
of the film may become available if the 
footage runs high enough. However, main- 
taining the constant calculation of $.025 
for the 1émm., $.04 for the 35mm. film the 
costs for subscribing libraries would stand 
as follows:

By the time forty libraries are

has become dominant and any economies in 
these costs would be felt immediately. 

The effect of differences in proc— 
essing costs when the number of subscribers 
reaches 40 is shown by recalculating the 
costs at maximum and minimum processing 
figures ($.055 maximum and $.025 minimum for 
35mm. film; $.05 maximum and $.0225 minimum 
for 16mm. film).

Microcopying "Reprint Costs" 

Microcopying, like book production, 
as has been stated, gives rise to both 
"first cost" and "running cost." The 
first cost in microcopying is compounded 
of two factors, the first of which is 
largely labor, and is dependent upon the 
number of pages copied, regardless of the 
area of film used; the second is film and 
processing, and is dependent upon the area 
of film used, regardless of the number of 
pages copied upon it. The labor cost of 
photographing is roughly analogous to the 
composition cost of book manufacture; it 
varies with the number of pages rather than 
the number of words. The running cost 
(that is to say, the cost that depends upon 
the number of copies) is simply the area 
cost of the first copy, multiplied by the 
size of edition. 

Another kind of cost is present in 
book manufacturing, the "reprint cost." 
This ieathes "first cost" ofspringingsoutee 
second edition. The reprint cost is less 
than the first cost of the first edition 
of a book provided plates are made from 
the type, or the photo-offset metal sheets 


134 





preserved for a second run. But the re- 
print cost in book manufacture, regardless 
of these economies, is always substantial. 
In microcopying large footages the reprint 
cost is nil. No special expense is in- 
curred in production if, when 10,000 feet 
of film have been distributed to each of 
ten subscribing libraries, an eleventh li- 
brary comes along a year later and asks to 
have an eleventh copy made for it. The 
cost of making the eleventh copy is simply 
the normal film—and-processing cost. For 
this reason microcopying offers remarkable 
elasticity in the distribution of material. 
There need never be an "overprint," made 
at the risk that no one will wish to buy 
it. This quality of microcopying, it must 
be remembered, is present only to the de- 
gree that the footage involved in a single 
order is large enough to obtain low proc-— 
essing prices. 


Short Footages in Unique Copies 

An application of microcopying 
that is already developing, and promises 
to have great utility in the future, is the 
making of microcopy negatives of books or 
periodical articles upon the order of in- 
dividual purchasers, whether research work— 
ers or libraries. The installation of ef- 
ficient photographic equipment may make it 
possible for a large library to make its 
resources generally available to readers 
anywhere at the price level of microcopy- 
ing. 

If the number of pages to be cop- 
ied per day in a library should be large 
enough to allow the continuous operation of 
the machine, the operating cost would rise 
above that of a long run of uniform mate- 
rial only to the extent that readjustments 
of focus became necessary in changing from 
books of one page size to books of another 
‘Size. The processing costs could still 
stand at the level of long rum work. An 
additional charge would be incurred in cut-— 
ting up the strips and mailing the short 
lengths to the various purchasers, but 
this type of service, in the experience of 
the Recordak Corporation (which cuts up 
long strips of bank records and mails them 
to individual banks) would not lift the 
costs to an entirely new level. Bookkeep- 
ing costs would appear, but it seems quite 
probable that on large-scale work the 
price level could be held down within

striking distance of the price of long- 
footage orders. 


Microcopying and Long-Distance Use of Li- 
braries: the "Bibliofilm Service" 


The most interesting effort to de- 
velop a service of this kind has been made 
by Mr. Atherton Seidell, Dr. R. H. Draeger 
of the U. S. Navy Department and Miss 
Claribel Barnett, librarian of the Depart— 


ment of Agriculture Library, Washington, 


D. C. In November 1934, Miss Barnett es-— 
tablished the "Bibliofilm Service" in the 
Library of the Department of Agriculture. 
The date is an important one in the history 
of microcopying applications. 

Miss Barnett has described the ad- 
ministrative routine of the Bibliofilm 
Service in an article in The Camera vol. lL, 
no. 5, May 1935, pp. 327-328, as follows: 


The procedure begins "with the suppli- 
ance of a 5" x 5" slip or card speci- 
fying the article desired--one such 
slip for each and every article, and 
each slip carrying the name and ad- 
dress of the customer. The slips are 
returned with the finished films. At- 
tendants take the slips, search the 
library, send the books to the photo- 
graphing room, there each article is 
copied on a continuous Strip of Tiilim, 
leaving spaces between for cutting. 
When all the day's orders are photo- 
graphed, the film will be developed, 
fixed, washed and dried, then cut up 
and each sequence attached to its 
proper slip and mailed to the cus— 
tomer or delivered by hand as it may 
be. Prepayment for the service is 
urged when possible, this to save ac- 
counting, etc., and a deposit of funds 
which may be drawn upon is possible. 


The film copies or "filmstats" as 
they are called are priced at $.10 for each 
article not exceeding ten pages, and $.05 
for each additional ten pages. The in- 
creasing use of the Bibliofilm Service is 
evident from a report in Agricultural Li- 
brary Notes for June, 1955; the number of 
pages copied per month rose from 470 in No- 
vember 1934, to 6,597 in May 1965. 

Miss Barnett writes that the rates 
during this experimental period have not 
covered the cost of keeping the records

and correspondence, but that the clerical 
cost may be materially lessened after the 
procedure has been better established. 
Moreover, the clerical costs as they stand 
are not greater, she believes, than those 
connected with the lending of books, for 
such costs as charging and discharging 
loans, or following up loaned volumes by 
correspondence to secure their return, are 
avoided. Studies of the cost of interli- 
brary loans made by the University of Cal- 
ifornia--though challenged by some libra- 
rians--set the cost of each loan at well 
over a dollar, and offer strong confirma- 
tion to the views of Miss Barnett. Schol- 
arship stands much indebted to her for the 
well-—conceived initiative. 

Other libraries have installed 
equipment for making microcopies, but the 
cameras used do not have the efficiency of 
the Draeger camera used by the Department 
of Agriculture Library. The price for mi- 
erocopies at the Library of Congress, the 
New York Public Library, and Yale Universi- 
ty Library is set at $3.00 per 100 expo- 
sures; at two pages per exposure, this 
amounts to $1.50 per 100 pages. Hunting- 
ton Library at San Marino, one of the first 
to install equipment, charges $5.00 per 100 
exposures, or $2.50 per 100 pages. A large 
microcopying machine has been installed in 
the Preussische Staatsbibliothek, but no 
quotations on service have been received 
by the Joint Committee. 

Since installation of equipment in 
America has already reached three of the 
largest libraries in the country, it is 
safe to say that at this very moment micro- 
copies of several million volumes of books 
and periodicals are already available to 
research workers at a price ($1.50 per 100 
pages) not much in excess of the normal 
price paid for books. Since the Wilson 
Union List of Periodicals in American Li- 
praries will inform any reader anywhere 
whether a given volume of a periodical is 
available at one or another of the libra- 
ries offering this service, scholars are 
now able to arrange with speed and certain- 
ty to have copied for them periodical ar- 
ticles not accessible in their own insti-

j Microcopying and Copyright

f 


While these innovations have of- 
fered a mechanical means of increasing the 





working power of scholars throughout the 
country, it has been necessary to prepare 
the legal ground for their use. For most 
of the learned journals from which schol- 
ars are likely to seek microcopies are cov— 
ered by copyright. With books it is other- 
wise; most of the rare and inaccessible 
books are probably the old books, on which 
copyright has expired. But the whole ques-— 
tion of photographic copying in its rela- 
tion to copyright has been full of uncer- 
tainties. 

Discussion with specialists in 
copyright problems showed that the law has 
been highly elaborated in court decisions 
to define the limits of so-called "fair 
use" when copyright material is republished 
BORE PLOtisb, MOU Oba lenOmCOuUrte decir slonsmeap— 
ply to the situation of the research worker 
who copies out notes from a copyrighted 
work in the course of his research. The let- 
ter of the statute would seem to indicate 
that the scholar with a fountain pen copy- 
ing paragraphs out of an article in a 
learned journal was engaged in technical 
violation of the copyright statute, but it 
seemed evident that the courts would neces-— 
sarily make a distinction between the kind 
of copying that is done in the course of 
research, when the copied matter merely en- 
ters a scholar's note file, and the reprint— 
ing of material for sale or distribution. 
The librarians had felt for some time that 
the uncertainties of the law hampered them 
in some measure in laying down policies in 
the use of the photostat, and it was clear 
that the extension of microcopying, because 
of the lower price level, would increase 
the problem. 

When the text of the new copyright 
law was under discussion in Washington in 
the spring of 1955, the suggestion was made 
that specific reference in the law should 
cover photographic copying for scholarly 
purposes; but the legal advisers of the 
publishers, while quite willing to have the 
photographic copying devices used to help 
schollarssin research, felt that such aypro— 
vision of the law would necessarily be so 
complex that it might either defeat its own 
purpose or undermine the whole structure of 
Ciejopiaealielalig.&lt; 

The whole subject was explored ina

Library, Mr. Milton Ferguson, chairman of 
the book-buying committee of the American 
Library Association, and Dr. Andrew Keogh 
of Yale University Library met with Mr. 
Frederic Melcher, chairman of the copy- 
right committee, and the board of direc-— 
tors of the National Association of Book 
Publishers. As a result of correspondence 
and conference to which a number of libra- 
rians contributed, a "gentlemen's agree— 
ment" on photographic copying for research 
purposes was drawn up and signed by Mr. W. 
W. Norton on behalf of the National Assoc-— 
dation of Book Publishers and by Dr. 
Robert C. Binkley on behalf of the Joint 
Committee on Materials for Research, 

The main principles of the agree— 
ment are, first, that photographic copies 
of parts of books or periodical volumes 
may be made by a library and delivered 
without profit to a purchaser in lieu of 
loan or manual transcription. The para-—

of a complete article from a periodical

volume, but it would not apply to the mi- 
crocopying of a whole volume or file of a 
periodical. The second principle is that 
the photographic copy is not to be a sub- 
stitute for the purchase of the material; 
it can be taken for granted that the known 
practices of research scholars in the col-. 
lecting of material for research will guide 
the intelligent application of this prin- 
ciple. The third’ principle ies thate umes ei 
brary which carries out the above princi- 
ples in good faith is not to be held liable 
for violation of copyright law, but that 
responsibility for any possible infringe- 
ment shall rest with the purchaser of the 
photographic copy. Subsequent correspond— 
ence has shown that some photographic copy-— 
ing problems arising in libraries are not 
explicitly covered by the agreement, but 
the main principles are sufficiently clear 
to justify the development of microcopying 
services in lieu of inter-library loans. 

The text of the agreement is repro- 
duced herewith: 


Correspondence and Agreement on the Photographic Copying by 
Libraries of Copyrighted Material 


Mr. W. W. Norton, President 


National Association of Book Publishers 


547 Fifth Avenue 
New York, New York 


Dear Sir: 


May 25, 1935 


On behalf of the Joint Committee on Materials for Research, I 


write to thank you for the consideration your organization has given to the 
increasing importance of the problem of conscientious observance of copyright 
that faces research libraries in connection with the growing use of photo- 
graphic methods of reproduction. Not so long ago the scholar or student con— 
tented himself with pencil or ink transcripts of passages in the books and 
periodicals he consulted in connection with his studies. The increased use, 
first of the fountain pen, then of the standard typewriter, then of the port— 
able typewriter, developed a corresponding increase in the number and amount 
of transcripts made for this same purpose. Within the past few years, the 
use of photography, the photostat, and now the 16 or 35 millimeter film cam— 
eras have added to the amount, the extent, the speed--and the problems—-of 
this reproduction. 

We realize, of course, that we can speak only on behalf of the 
publishers, libraries and research workers of this country. The problem is of 
importance also in connection with foreign copyrighted books, particularly the 
publications of academies or learned societies and the unofficial periodical

press printing the results of research. As to such books and periodicals, 
the foreign publisher or copyright owner is the final authority. We feel, 
however, that the common interests of both groups would make it fair for us 
to assume that the practice approved by American publishers and libraries 
would satisfy their brothers in other countries. 

We are told that from time to time instructors in various 
schools and colleges have reproduced in one way or another extensive por- 
tions or whole chapters from copyrighted textbooks, which have been sold or 
given to their classes as substitutes for the textbooks. We see how keen an 
injustice and how severe a harm is done to the owner of the copyright by such 
practices, and we participate with you in the condemnation of such obvious 
violations of copyright. 

The indication you have given of what publishers and authors, 
as owners of copyright, can suggest to archives offices and museums as a 
guide to a code of fair practice in connection with the commendable form of 
public service rendered by photographic methods of reproduction is so clari- 
fying that we suggest it be put in the form of an agreement and published. 


Very sincerely yours,

Dear Dr. Binkley: 

We deeply appreciate your desire to work out a code of fair 
practice which will protect the rights of authors and research workers. As 
publishers we naturally do not wish to impose restrictions which might hamper 
students in collecting research material, but on the other hand it is neces— 
sary for us all to face this problem realistically and not permit the rapid 
extension of photocopying to lead to a disregard of the fundamental principles 
ObeCcopyrLe hic. 

The results of the conference in our office, attended by Mr. 
Lydenberg, Mr. Ferguson, and Dr. Keogh and members of our committee, have 
been discussed with Mr. Frederic Melcher, Chairman of the Association Copy- 
right Committee, and by our Board of Directors. We are happy to have the re- 
sults of these conferences put in the form of an agreement and published with 
this correspondence. 

Very sincerely yours,

METHODS OF REPRODUCING RESEARCH MATERIALS 





The Joint Committee on Materials for Research and the Board 
of Directors of the National Association of Book Publishers, after confer- 
ring on the problem of conscientious observance of copyright that faces re- 
search libraries in connection with the growing use of photographic methods 
of reproduction, have agreed upon the following statement: 


A library, archives office, museum, or similar institution owning 
books or periodical volumes in which copyright still subsists may 
make and deliver a single photographic reproduction or reduction of 
a part thereof to a scholar representing in writing that he desires 
such reproduction in lieu of loan of such publication or in place of 
manual transcription and solely for the purposes of research; pro- 
vided 
(1) That the person receiving it is given due notice in writing 
that he is not exempt from liability to the copyright pro- 
prietor for any infringement of copyright by misuse of the 
reproduction constituting an infringement under the copyright 
law; 
(2) That such reproduction is made and furnished without profit 
iO) skicsiellae Joyy claxes Shasrealimohestous meyetiaye, abt). 
The exemption from liability of the library, archives office or museum 
herein provided for shall extend to every officer, agent or employee 
of such institution in the making and delivery of such reproduction 
when acting within the scope of his authority of employment. This 
exemption for the institution itself carries with it a responsibility 
to see that library employees caution patrons against the misuse of 
copyright material reproduced photographically. 


Under the law of copyright, authors or their agents are assured 
of "the exclusive right to print, reprint, publish, copy and vend the copy— 
righted work," all or any part. This means that legally no individual or in- 
stitution can reproduce by photography or photomechanical means, mimeograph or 
other methods of reproduction a page or any part of a book without the written 
permission of the owner of the copyright. Society, by law, grants this exclu- 
sive right for a term of years in the belief that such exclusive control of 
creative work is necessary to encourage authorship and scholarship. 

While the right of quotation without permission is not provided 
in law, the courts have recognized the right to a "fair use" of book quotations, 
the length of a "fair" quotation being dependent upon the type of work quoted 
from and the "fairness" to the author's interest. Extensive quotation is obvi- 
ously inimical to the author's interest. 

The statutes make no specific provision for a right of a re- 
search worker to make copies by hand or by typescript for his research notes, 
but a student has always been free to "copy" by hand; and mechanical reproduc— 
tions from copyright material are presumably intended to take the place of hand 
transcriptions, and to be governed by the same principles governing hand trans— 
Cri puLon. 

In order to guard against any possible infringement of copyright, 
however, libraries, archives offices and museums should require each applicant 
for photomechanical reproductions of material to assume full responsibility for 
such copying, and by his signature to a form printed for the purpose assure the 
institution that the duplicate being made for him is for his personal use only j 
and is to relieve him of the task of transcription. The form should clearly in- J 
dicate to the applicant that he is obligated under the law not to use the mate-— 
rial thus copied from books for any further reproduction without the express 
permission of the copyright owner. ;

It would not be fair to the author or publisher to make possi- 
ble the substitution of the photostats for the purchase of a copy of the book 
itself either for an individual library or for any permanent collection in a 


public or research library. 


Orders for photocopying which, by reason of their 


extensiveness or for any other reasons, violate this principle should not be 


accepted. 


In case of doubt as to whether the excerpt requested complies with 


this condition, the safe thing to do is to defer action until the owner of 
the copyright has approved the reproduction. 

Out-of-print books should likewise be reproduced only with 
permission, even if this reproduction is solely for the use of the institution 


making it and not for sale. 


"Publishing" Short Runs of Material by 
Microcopying 

Onesol the most intricate, and at 
the same time the most important, of the 
problems encountered in the use of micro- 
copying is its possible substitution for 
publication. 

In its simplest form, such a sub-— 
stitution for publication would take place 
automatically if a library which offers 
microcopying service has in its possession 
unpublished material, and the probable pur- 
chasers of such material are aware of its 
existence and availability through the 
usual bibliographical guides. For in- 
stance, if a typescript copy of a monograph 
should be deposited in the Library of the 
Department of Agriculture, and listed or 
given notice in the learned journals, the 
Public Affairs Information Service, and 
other bibliographical guides, it would be, 
in effect, "published" to the degree that 
scholars would be willing to buy and use 
MAC OCC Pie S Olen Libr. 

But in such a case each individual 
purchaser would require that the book be 
photographed anew. A new negative would 
be produced for each "sale" of the book. 

Would it be possible to organize 
the distribution of microcopies of such a 
work in a way that would take advantage of 
the labor-saving that can occur when a 
number of positives are made from a single 
negative? Of course, if the material in 
question fills a large enough film footage, 
the additional copies after the first neg-

ative are available with present technique 
at a price lower than the cost of the first 
negative. But in the case of a short strip 
of film--a few inches or a few feet--there 
is at present no way of taking advantage of 
the theoretically low cost of making a num- 
ber of prints from a single negative in the 
production of positive prints to order. 
What is the amount and behavior of such an- 
ticipated economies? What is the differ- 
ence between the cost of making a negative 
microcopy from a book and the cost of mak-— 
ing a positive from a negative? And what 
is the cost of maintaining a catalogue, and 
shelving or storage system for film nega- 
tives? 

It has been shown that, for long 
footages, the cost of making a positive 
from a negative is not greater than the 
processing cost of the same footage of neg— 
ative. Even short items can be produced 
as negatives at the low processing cost of 
the long footage, because a large number 
of items are copied on a long roll, and the 
roll subsequently cut up. But if positive 
copies are to be made from the short scraps 
of negative, the. processing cost rises. 
Short scraps of negative give rise to high 
costs in making positive copies. But the 
cataloguing and storage expenses for short 
pieces are as high; sper item, as for Long 
strips. Consequently for short items it 
will be wasteful to save the negative, for 
long items wasteful not to save it. The 
dividing line is probably the 100-foot 
reel, which may mean a unit of 2,000 pages. 


140 





For the shorter items--and this 
means for most scientific literature——pres-— 
ent apparatus will not justify the expense 
of holding a negative for the sake of mak-— 
Ine A eMUMD er Oise POS ita se txcOMe shame Uli aeloty 
a large number of microcopies of a scien- 
tific article are to be made from the same 
paper copy, the paper itself may wear out 
in the repeated photographing. "Publica- 
tion" by microcopy methods would put upon 
a book the same amount of wear that would 
take place if every reader used the same 
copy. Librarians who have administered 
"reserve book rooms" for large university 
classes know how quickly a book will wear 
out under constant use. 

This is the problem to which Dr. 
Watson Davis of Science Service has de- 
voted a vast amount of intensive thought 
and planning. The solution suggested by 
him is an important contribution to the 
use of microcopying, and to the organiza— 
tion of the distribution of scientific 
literature. He proposes that the negative 
made from an original typescript, or in- 
deed a negative made from a published ar- 
ticle or book, should take the form, not 
of a length of film strip but of a rectan— 
Sale Ome 1am ee Sides Oat CO pein@ Teal elelind Cenc eee mC cial 
catalogue. It is deemed technically pos-— 
sible to put 150 pages of microcopied ma- 
terial on a 3" x 5" card (a 70mm. film ecut 
into 5" strips would measure 2 3/4" x 5"), 
Even if the number of pages that can be 
copied on such a card is materially less 
than 150 pages, the essential value of his 
suggestion lies in its answer to two of 
the most difficult problems in microcopy—

vantage of his plan. The second advantage 
appears in connection with processing. To 
make a positive print from’ a short strip 
of motion picture film is more difficult 
than to make a print from a single rectan- 
gle of film. His plan should tend to make 
“reprint costs" for short items behave as 
if the items were long, and at the same 
time eliminate a heavy cataloguing and 
storing charge. 


METHODS OF REPRODUCING RESEARCH MATERIALS 








It has been suggested by several 
writers that the future may see whole li- 
braries copied on film, and the negatives 
stored in such a way that positive copies 
from any of them can be run off on demand. 
It is sometimes thought that when a library, 
in responding to a demand for a microcopy 
of an item, makes a negative copy, it 
should make a positive from the negative, 
send the positive to the purchaser, and re— 
tain the negative to make positives for 
other purchasers. This is the procedure 
that the technique of photography suggests 
as normal. But how does it fit into the 
practical administration of library re- 
sources? 

In the analysis of library costs, 
it was established that cataloguing and 


Shelving of books are items of library ex- 


pense that approach in magnitude, or even 
pass, the cost of the books themselves. Mi- 
crocopying in lieu of inter-library lending, 
when organized like the U. S. Department of 
Agriculture Bibliofilm Service, imposes no 
extra cataloguing charges on the library. 
The film service simply uses the existing 
catalogue and shelving system. If an ef- 
fort is to be made to use a negative more 
than onee, the library must control its 
negatives by means of a catalogue system 
that will parallel its book catalogue, 
growing with the growth of the collection 
of negative films. This extra cost can be 
made up only if it results in substantial 
economies. 

Dr. Davis has received from the 
Chemical Foundation a grant which he will 
use to develop the apparatus necessary to 
put his plan into effect. When the appara-— 
tus is ready, the day will have arrived 
when microcopying is technically suited to 
do for the intellectual world what publish-— 
ing has hitherto done, with immeasurably 
greater elasticity and at a fraction of the 
cost. “Lhe long erolivor tiimeywislieorol abil, 
remain as the best medium for the micro- 
copying of long items, because it will do } 
for the microcopies what binding does for 
a book-—keep the series in its fixed order. 
The card negative will serve for the short 
items, arranged in an open order, with new 
items placed between items already in the

The Problem of Standardization of Equipment 


and Reduction Ratio 
A memorandum by Mr. Verneur E. Pratt

COST LEVELS AND APPLICATIONS OF MICROCOPYING AND PROJECTION READING 


of the International Filmbook Corporation, 
and a series of letters and memoranda by 
Dr. Watson Davis, call attention to the 
vital importance of standardization in the 
development of apparatus for microcopying. 
Mr. Pratt writes: 


If certain rumors and actual 
reports are to be considered authen- 
tic, there is an alarming disparity 
in the use of films. Some are plan- 
ning microcopies to be made on 16mm. 
film; others upon 35mm. film, still 
others upon widths not usually con- 
sidered standard. The minifications 
vary from 12 to 24. Some projec-— 
tors and cameras now being designed 
and readied for the market are adopt- 
ing 55mm. film with the customary 
double row of sprocket holes. Others, 
with a view of salvaging more of the 
available area, are planning on the 
use of film on which but one row of 
sprocket holes is punched. A camera 
concern is developing a reading ma- 
chine which uses no sprocket holes 

Furthermore, there is as yet 
MOMS DanGarc lz eb tom Oierblstadne sO. 
separation of dockets, folios or pag- 
es. There is no uniformity of treat- 
ment in locating pages on the film-- 
some photographing newspaper pages 
vertically but book pages horizontal- 
ly. Some are ignoring frame lines 
and others attempting to squeeze a 
certain number of pages into the def- 
inite standard film size. 

Unless this situation is im- 
mediately controlled through action 
of a standardization committee, this 
lack of uniformity is going to cost 
mildtons of dollars to’ correet. in 
the early days of electric lamps each 
manufacturer brought out his own 
specifications of the base. The re- 
sult was that electric lamps had to 
be especially made to fit each manu- 
facturer's sockets. No one has been 
able to calculate the millions which 
this foolish lack of standardization 
Cost. 


The problem of standardization 
brings to the fore the important fact that 
microcopying involves not only the manufac— 





141 


ture of the copies themselves, but also 

the distribution of reading equipment. The 
cheaper the reading equipment, the more 
easily will it be distributed to a number 
of scholars sufficient to render practical 
the large-scale utilization of microcopying 
in research. But at the same time, the re- 
duction in the price of reading equipment 
means an increase in the cost of microcop- 
ies, because reading machines that will 
handle the high reduction ratios that go 
with low-cost micro-films will be more ex- 
pensive than reading machines that handle 
only low reduction ratios. The manufactur- 
ing cost of reading equipment increases 
with the reduction ratio of the microcopy 
it is prepared to handle, and with the area 
of reading matter laid before the reader at 
a time. The magnifying power, field of 
vision, and the light intensity (which de- 
termines the amount of contrast in the pro- 
jected image) are the three optical ele- 
ments of the reading equipment which seem 
to have the controlling position in the de- 
termination of costs of equipment. There 
are other important points to be noted in 
reading equipment, such as ease of loading 
the film, or ease in passing from one page 
to another, but these can be ignored for 
the moment. They are independent of 

the choice of magnifying power, field of 
vision and light intensity. 

As soon as the cost of reading ma-— 
chines is introduced into the analysis of 
microcopy costs, the remarkable fact emerg- 
es that some of the fundamental elements of 
publishing accountancy are still present, 
but with the situations of the publisher 
and reader reversed. If a reader buys for 
#100 a reading machine which he uses to 
read 1,000 pages, he is paying $.10 a page 
for reading equipment; if he gets 100,000 
pages of reading matter, the cost per page 
of his reading equipment is only 1/10 of a 
cent. His reading machine is a "first 
cost," and the footage of film he acquires 
or uses in it a "rumning cost." If he cuts 
this first cost by purchasing a projector 
that will not handle microcopies of 23 di- 
ameters reduction, but will accept only mi- 
crocopies-of 9 ory 12 -dlameters reduction, 
his running cost of reading matter will rise 
because he must pay more per page for the

contenting himself with a machine that will 
show only a small area of projected image 


142 


METHODS OF REPRODUCING RESEARCH MATERIALS 





at a time, or give a lower light intensity, 
he may retain the low running cost of his 
reading matter, but must accept a sacri- 
fice in’ the legibility factor. 

The situation may be clarified by 
an illustration taken from transportation. 
The railway (like publishing in printed 
form) imposes a heavy first cost in making 
every trip. But this cost per passenger 
will fall with the number of passengers, 
exactly as the cost per reader of printed 
books falls with the number of copies sold. 
The railway company makes the initial in- 
vestment, the passenger pays only for what 
he uses, just as the publisher carries the 
Libba wCOsS bang emis Ole pub ld Shinar cad 
the book buyer limits his investment to 
what he can actually use. The system will 
only be economically justifiable if a 
large number of people wish to go to the 
same place at the same time, just as pub- 
lishing is only economically feasible if 
the saleable edition is large. 

The quantitative relationship be- 
tween the higher cost of projectors to 
read film at high reduction ratios and the 
lower cost of the film itself is easily es-— 
tablished from the calculations made above 
of the cost of microcopying the English 
books printed before 1640. Basing this 
calculation on the estimates of the cost 
to the libraries of film when forty libra- 
ries purchase copies, two quantities can 
be plotted against each other on a graph. 
On one axis is the cost differential be- 
tween high power and low power projectors; 
on the other axis is the cost differential 
between high reduction and low reduction 
film. The figures for the film are ex- 
pressed in thousands of pages, the figures 
for the projector in dollar differences be- 
tween alternative reading machine prices. 
Every 30,000 pages will justify an expen- 
diture of an additional $25.00 for a read- 
ing machine. 

The passenger has an alternative: 
he may buy a car. In that case he will 
have a fixed cost per mile for gas and oil, 
like the cost per page of books purchased 
PnanIcrocopys Lorm. Sihws "CosG wwiselbericon— 
stant, no matter how much he travels. He 
can go where he will, whether anyone else 
is going there at the same time or not, 
just as the microcopy reader can get any 
item in micrucopy form, whether other read-— 
ers want it or not. He is limited only by

the road network, as the reader of micro- 
copies is limited only by the resources of 
libraries offering microcopying service; 

and in this respect both car owner and mi- 
crocopy reader are users of public proper- 
ty. And the microcopy, like the automobile, 
if used on a large scale, may change the 
whole design of a compartment of life. But 
the development of microcopying in lieu of, 
or as a supplement to, printed book publi- 
cation, like the development of the automo- 
bile in its relation to railway travel, 

will attain its technological possibilities 
only to the degree that a wide market cuts 
the first cost of the reading equipment, 

the individual owners of it distribute this 
first cost over a large footage of film, land 
the libraries offer the services that ren—

fantasy, that the automobile in its 
early stages had been some kind of a 
machine that required for its opera- 
DIChMa me SDeCLaAle kind or road. Then let 
us suppose that in one part of the 
country roads were under construction 
that would serve for one make of auto- 
mobile, while in another part of the 
country roads were built for another 
make of car, with road and automobile 
so related that the machine built to 
go on one road would not go on anoth- 
er} That is the kind of problem fac-— 
ing the intellectual world at this 
moment in the standardization of mi- 
crocopying. Shall we build a projec- 
tor that will read any microcopied 
film, whether card or film strip, 
whether broad or narrow, whether 

a high or low reduction ratio? Con- 
ceivably such projectors can be de- 
Silenced,  DULewill “not theilr® cosu be so 
high that wide distribution will be fore- 
stalled? Or shall we have several makes 
of projector, each adapted to a particular 
kind of microcopy film, in which case the 
utility of each to the reader will be lim- 
ited even though the price be less. Or 
shall libraries and others standardize 
their microcopying in such a way that one 
simple projector will serve for all pur- 
poses, im which case there is a risk that 
the chosen standard may not be the best, 
and almost a certainty that if it is well 
adapted to one type of material (as a long 
file of newspapers) it will be ill adapted 
to another type of material (as a short 
typescript monograph). 

There are at present too many un- 
knowns to permit the solution of this in- 
tricate equation. But the facts and prin- 
ciples already set forth will serve at 
least to eliminate some of the unknowns, 
and to simplify in some measure the prob- 
lem of standardization.

Essentials of Design for Reading Equipment: 


(a) Length of Line 
Into this labyrinth there are many 


approaches. The analysis might begin with 
estimates of buying power of various cate- 
gories of institutions and readers; with 

estimates of the number of pages likely to 
be copied and hence the comparison of the 

relative importance to be attached to film 
prices and equipment prices; with a calcu-

lation of the probability that the essence 
of the matter lies in the short items on 
the one hand, long footages on the other; 
or with an anticipatory measurement of the 
proportions which various classes of read- 
ing matter, such as newspapers, books, man—

microcopied material. But there is one 
seemingly trivial dimension which appears 
TOME WEL bere uOnOCcCuUpy. a acrucialsposiuLorm 
in determining policy, and that is the 
length of the line of print, typescript or 
manuseript. “This unit, it has been noted, 
always bears some relation to size of print 
of type, and also to size of page. Bad 
typography or writing may make the line too 
long for the print, but there will always 
be some limits to the variation. Small 
type is almost invariably set in shorter 
lines than large type, and if a large page 
is to be used with small type, the type ap- 
pears in the form of columns on the page. 
The resolving power of a photographic emul- 
Sion and process is exhibited in the repro- 
duction of a letter, the labor cost of mak- 
ing an original negative microcopy is a 
quantity that varies with the number of 
pages, the processing costs of film vary 
with footage, but the technological meet— 
ing point of microcopying and microreading 
devices is found in the line of reading 





matter. 


Copying and reading devices are not 
incompatible though they differ greatly in 
the way in which they render the size of 
print or of page. A given piece of film, 
when put in one projector, may yield an 
image equivalent to 8-point type, in an- 
other projector an image equivalent to 
16-point type. The same film might show 
in one projector a spread of two pages laid 
before the reader's eye at once, in another 
projector one page only, and in a third 
projector only the upper half of a page. 
These differences would not render the 
projectors incompatible with each other, 
nor with the microcopying camera. But if 
a camera makes a microcopy in such dimen- 
Sions that the projector will display from 
it an image that does not show full lines, 
the two are absolutely incompatible. 

Already there have appeared in the 
development of microcopying apparatus sev-— 
eral outstanding examples of this incom-— 
patibility. The Recordak newspaper projec-— 
tor projects an image from a full frame of 


144 








a lémm. film or from one quarter of the 
"double frame" of a 35mm. film. A newspa- 
per page, copied on the Eastman Recordak 
machine, is projected and read, a quarter- 
page at a time. There is no incompatibil- 
ity here, for the quarter-page of the news- 
paper holds several columns, and no lines 
of reading are broken off in the middle. 
But the Library of Congress microcopies of 
manuscripts from foreign archives have 
been made to the number of over a million 
‘pages on 55mm. film, and most of them in 
the "first position" noted above, i.e., 
one page to a double frame, with the lines 
running full across the film. These film 
copies are incompatible with the Recordak 
projector. The Carnegie Endowment for In- 
ternational Peace, acting on the advice of 
the writer, made copies of the Paris Peace 
Conference papers of Colonel House at the 
Yale University Library. These were copied 
in the same position as the Library of Con- 
gress documents from foreign archives, and 
are equally incompatible with tne Recordak 
projector. The NRA hearings were copied 
on 16mm. film in the same position, i.e., 
with lines running full across the filn, 
but since the full width of the film is on- 
ly half the width of the 35mm. film, the 
Recordak projector will display a full page 
of the typescript, not cutting any lines. 
The present tentative design of a 
projection apparatus to be made by the In- 
ternational Filmbook Company seems to show 
that less than the full area of a book page 
is to be projected. About a dozen lines of 
print appear on the screen at a time. Then 
the film is moved to bring the remainder of 
the page into view. The projector is com- 
patible only with film that has the lines 
running transversely across the film strip, 
aswel pos. tons. 5 and 3--or indeed in 
the multiple arrangement suggested by Mr. 
Pratt. (see above.) To conform to this 
type of reading apparatus, Mr. Pratt recom— 
mends as 


locating all pages vertically on the 
film, with the lines of the printed 
matter at right angles to the length

permit the reading of lines running in ei- 
ther direction, and will expose a variable 
film area by substituting lenses and con- 

densers. 

The Bibliofilm Service photograph- 
ers, using the Draeger camera, copy their 
pages in the second position on 35mm. film. 
If they should copy in the first position, 
their film could not be read in a Recordak 
projector; the copies they are making in 
the second position cannot be read in the 
International Filmbook Teledex, but can be 
read in the International Filmbook Optigraph 
if the rolls are long enough; if they should 
copy in the third position their film would 
be readable in either the Recordak or Film- 
book projector. 


Essentials of Design for Reading Equipment. 


(b) The Page Rectangle 
Another given quantity, independent 


of any choice made by the designers of mi- 
crocopying or reading equipment, is the 
general proportions of the normal page of 
reading matter. Ordinarily the page, wheth— 
er of typescript, manuscript or print, sea 
rectangle of which the vertical dimension 
is greater than the horizontal by a factor 
of 25%. to. 50%... 821/202 x11 eGo mea 
other standard sizes from folio to duodec-— 
imo carry these proportions. The propor- 
tions are independent of the size of the 
page, and equally independent of reduction 
ratio in photographing or enlargement ratio 
in reading. They are related to length of 
line, because the line always corresponds 
to the short side of the page rectangle 
(except for pages set in more than one col- 
umn). 

Taken in conjunction with two other 
fixed elements of the problem, namely, 
(1) the standardization of the width of the 
film and (2) the advantage of using the full 
area of the film the page rectangle, the 
proportions of the page rectangle become 
important determinants of design. This fact 
becomes especially noticeable when a fixed 
frame camera is used for copying. 

The ordinary moving picture frame 
on 35mm. film is a rectangle 1" x 3/4", 
with the long side across the film; the 
"double frame" used in the Leica, Contax, 
and Ludwig cameras exposes an area 1" x 
1 3/8", or 18 x 1 2/2", withe they shortecic. 
across the film. Edwards Brothers of Ann

COST LEVELS AND APPLICATIONS OF MICROCOPYING AND PROJECTION READING 


Kuropean books made with a single frame 
camera; the equipment at Yale, New York 
Public Library, and Huntington Library, is 
of the double-frame type. With a single- 
frame camera, pages can be copied in the 
second or third position without loss of 
film area; with a double-frame camera pag- 
es can be copied in the first and second 
position without loss. But if a single- 
frame camera is used to copy pages in the 
first position, or a double-frame camera 
to copy them in the third position, from 
one-third to one-half of the area of the 
film is wasted. 

These considerations do not apply 
to copying cameras with changeable frames, 
but so much copying equipment is already 
set up with fixed frames, and especially 
with the fixed double frame, that any 
standardization of projectors that would 
force users of double-frame cameras to 
waste from one-third to one-half of their 
film in order to render their copying com- 
patible with reading equipment would incur 
disadvantages in distribution. This fact,

translated into terms of design, seems to 
call for projectors that can be adjusted to 
read lines of print that run across the 
film as well as lines that run along the 
aipleluyts

So far as the optical system is 
concerned, the important fact to notice is 
that pages always appear as rectangles, of 
which the short side is the line of print. 
TIwo-page rectangles may be photographed on 
one film rectangle, but the initial propor- 
tions of the page rectangle will still con- 
trol the proportions of the rectangle of 
film used in copying them. If the camera 
has a fixed frame area, either single-frame 
or double-frame, the proportions of the film 
rectangle are determined by the camera. But 
even if the camera is adjustable and can 
expose a larger or smaller length of film 
at a time, the proportions of the page will

longer than the short side. 


Essentials of Design for Reading Kquipment. 
(c) the Aperture 

The aperture of a lens is usually 
measured as a diameter of the lens circle: 
but in connection with the problem of pro- 
jecting pages it must be given another 
meaning. The aperture dimension that is 
effective for reading microcopied pages is 
the length of the long side of a rectangle 
with the proportions of a page (roughly 1" 
x 11/2"), that can be inscribed in the 
lens circle. The word "aperture" as used 
below is a lens area covering a rectangle 
of film measured along its long side. The 
aperture thus defined need not correspond 
in size to the page rectangle on the film, 
nor to the film rectangle which holds the 

image of one or two pages, nor the single 
frame or double frame that has its dimen- 
sions set by the camera. But in the ratio 
Ola SmLOngusd Cem tbOn cS chorte sid emate wale: 
still follow the general proportions of a 
page. The aperture is to the projector 
what the frame of film is to the camera. 

It is possible to read a large 
frame of film with a small aperture if the 
film frame is moved in front of the aper- 
ture, so that the different parts are pro- 
jected successively. This is true whether 
the frame of film has been used to copy 
one or two or even more pages. If the 
long side of an aperture equals the long 
side of a page rectangle, the page can be 
read without moving the film; if the long 
side of the aperture equals the short side 
of the page rectangle the page can be read 
by moving the film in front of the aper- 
ture; if the long side of the aperture is 
less than the short side of the page rec-— 
tangle, the film and projector are incom- 
patible, and the page cannot be read at 
all, (unless, indeed, the page happens to 
be set up on columns, and the long side of 
the aperture is equal to the width of the 
microcopied column). 

To consider an extreme case; two 
pages can be photographed (in the third po- 
sition) on a single frame of film. One 
page of the original print will correspond

Go nalts) franemot tt lm ht Sa Oongecuce 
will be 3/4", its short side 1/2"; the 
length of line will be 1/2". The aperture 
required for reading this film need be on- 
ly 1/2" (1/2" x 3/8") but in reading this 
film with a 1/2" aperture, the film must be 
moved successively into four different po- 
sitions: first, to read the top sor whe 
first page; then to read the bottom of the 
first page; then to read the top of the 
second page; and finally to read the bot- 
tom of the second page. An aperture of 1" 
(1" x 3/4") would make it possible to read 
both pages without moving the film; an 
aperture of 1 1/2" (1 1/e" x 1") would not 
only permit the reading of both pages at 
once but would also lay before the reader's 
eyes, at the same time, two frames of film, 
with four pages of reading matter. 

These principles are used in the 
Recordak newspaper projector. A newspaper 
is reduced sixteen diameters on 55mm. film. 
The aperture of the lens projects from the 
newspaper page rectangle (1" x 11/2") an 
area roughly 1/2" x 3/4". The film is 
moved in front of the aperture in such a 
way that the reader has before him at any 
time a projection of about a quarter of the 
newspaper page. Since the newspaper print 
is set in columns, this arrangement does 
not violate the principle that the aperture 
must be sufficient to exhibit the full 
length of a line. But in the case of the 
streamer headlines, running full across the 
newspaper page, this principle is violated, 
for the reader cannot have before his eye 
at one time a full streamer headline. This 
is an admitted inconvenience. It is over- 
looked in the Recordak design because a 
very small proportion of the reading matter 
of a newspaper consists of streamer head- 
lines. 

The dimensions of length of line 
and the proportions of the page rectangle, 
when considered in connection with the 
standardized 65mm. and 16mm. film define 
certain specific dimensions in aperture as 
fixed alternatives in design. 

An aperture 1 1/2" will display the 
long side of a page rectangle taken on a 
double frame of 35mm. film. An aperture 
of 1/2" will display the short side of a 
page rectangle taken on 16mm. film. The

intermediate steps in the series are show 
on the chart on the following page. 

These dimensions for aperture are 
final in the sense that there is no reason 
for building apparatus that will use an 
aperture intermediate between them. There 
is no use for an aperture of more than 
11/2" for 35mm. film; there is no use in 
making the aperture larger than 3/4" un- 
léss it is made a full inch; there is no 
stopping point between 1/2" and 3/4". An 
aperture of 5/8" is wasteful; it can ac-— 
complish nothing that is not equally well 
accomplished with an aperture of 1/2". 
These conclusions follow from the fact that 
the standard dimensions of the film and 
the normal proportions of a page rectangle 
are fixed quantities. 


Essentials of Design for Reading Equipment: 
(d) the Enlargement Ratio 

With these apertures accepted as 
fixed alternatives for reading equipment, 
it remains not only to decide between them, 
but also to decide upon an enlargement ra-— 
GeOre 





The enlargement ratio has only two 
fixed points that can be deduced from oth- 
er fixed elements of the situation. It 
should hardly be less than six diameters, 
for then it would overlap the possibili- 
ties of a‘rect optical magnifying by read- 
ing glass equipment. It is shown above 
that the cost of photosensitive surface on 
film is about four times that of the paper 
Surface. If a 6" x 9" page is to be 
copied in the first position on 35mm. filn, 
with a reduction of 6 diameters, it could 
be copied at no greater materials cost on 
paper in a reduction of 3 diameters. The 
paper copy, legible with a reading glass, 
would offer marked convenience in storage 
and filing. Equipment for making such pa- 
per copies is in sight. It would seem, 
therefore, that no enlargements of less 
than six diameters need be considered. Pos-— 
sibly the same argument in favor of paper 
could be extended to cover enlargements of 
eight or even of ten diameters, but for the 
moment it can be concluded that there is 
somewhere a minimum enlargement below which 
projection equipment is umnecessary, and 
this minimum is certainly six, and possibly 
10, diameters. 

The upper limit of enlargement is 
dependent upon the range of the high reduc-— 





147 


tion vratiog. it Loey are set at 16 for 
newsprint and 24 for typescript, then the 
reading equipment will follow by disregard- 
ing the possibility of enlargement in a 
higher degree. If the reduction ratio 
should be pushed up--as some experimenters 
propose--to 40 diameters for typescript, 
the projector will have to follow it. These 
considerations fix the upper and lower lim- 
its for enlarging power in reading equip- 
ment. Between them there are no fixed sta- 
ACM Sim 

The enlargement ratio is, however, 
related in an important way to aperture. 
For instance, to take an extreme case, it 
is evident that a 1/4" aperture in a ma- 
chine that would make enlargements of only 
10 diameters would have a very restricted 
use; the octavo book pages or typescript 
pages that would have their length of line 
brought down to 1/4" would have to pass 
through a reduction of 24 or more diame- 
ters. The projected image of such a micro- 
copy, if enlarged only 10 diameters, would 
be less than half the original size and 
might therefore be illegible. On the other 
hand, a machine with a 1 1/2" aperture set 
to make enlargements of 20 diameters, 
while it would be useful in projecting a 
full newspaper page at once, would be waste- 
ful in projecting microcopied books that 
had passed through a reduction ratio of 20 
because it would show more pages than nec-— 
essary, and would be equally wasteful in 
projecting book pages that had been en— 
larged only 10 diameters, because it would 
raise the size of the print to poster size. 

There is another and equally sig- 
nificant relationship between aperture and 
enlargement ratio. The cost of a lens and 
condenser system increases with the enlarge- 
ment ratio, but diminishes with the aper- 
ture. Thus an optical system with large 
aperture and low enlargement ratio will 
cost the same as an optical system with 
small aperture and high enlargement ratio. 
If the present design of a certain reading 
equipment renders it too costly, the cost 
can be reduced by redesigning it either for 
smaller aperture or for lower enlarging 
power. If reading equipment at present 
available has insufficient enlarging power, 
the design can be altered to give a higher 
enlarging power without. altering the cost, 
but only by diminishing. the aperture. 

It might be argued that enlargement

ratio can always be increased by bringing 
the lens nearer to the film, and setting 
the screen further from the lens. Thus a 
very cheap projector will make enlarge- 
ments of 40 or more diameters by throwing 
an image on a distant wall. It does not 
follow, however, that a lens system de- 
vised to make enlargements of 10 diame- 
ters can be readjusted to make enlarge- 
ments of 20 diameters, because the low 
power lens will not give the requisite 
definition, and the lighting system will 
not give the requisite contrast. The man-— 
ufacturers of projectors will constantly 
be driven back to the alternative of sac-— 
rificing aperture for enlarging power, or 
enlarging power for aperture, or of sacri- 
ficing market if they standardize at a 
cost level that gives high enlarging power 
and large aperture. 

The terms of the equation to be 
solved by the industry are now set. It re- 
mains only to discover exactly which alter-— 
native aperture-enlargement combinations 
are available at various cost levels. What 
are the combinations of aperture and en- 
largement that can be sold for $40, for 
#60, for $100? The figures arranged 
above, showing the immense effect of the 
high reduction ratios in’ cutting the cost 
of film will exert a pressure toward the 
adoption of high enlarging power with 
small aperture. The argument for low en- 
larging power and large aperture will turn 
on several points, of which the most im- 
portant probably are: 


1. That much equipment now in the hands of 
scholars is of the double-frame type, 
using 55mm. film, and with ordinary page 
copying this operates at the lower re-

copying require a degree of skill that 

the scholar, an amateur in photography, 
often cannot supply. He can safely 

make mistakes in focusing, exposing, 

and processing at 10 diameters of re- 

duction, through the same errors would 

be fatal if he were making reductions 

of 20 diameters.

4. That the large-scale ventures in copy- 
ing, such as the NRA and AAA code hear- 
ings, or the two million pages of early 
English books, which make the high re- 
duction ratios so advantageous, involve 
the expenditure of such large sums that 
they could sustain the manufacture of 
special equipment for reading the films 
made in such quantity. 


It is certain that there is a clear 
need for some reading equipment, such as 
the Recordak, that will handle reductions 
of 16 or more diameters by making enlarge- 
ments of 16 te 7 20 diameters. “Shouldgau: 
reading equipment be adapted to this use, 
or should there be an alternative line of 
projectors suited only to the reading of 
material copied in the zone of 10 diame- 
ters? If all reading equipment is to be 
adapted to the reading of material copied 
in the high reduction ratios, should it be 
designed to meet a low price level by sac- 
rificing aperture? The analysis given 
above may clarify the problem and thus as-— 
sist in its solution, but it cannot estab-— 
lish a proved answer. 

The four companies now most active 
in developing reading equipment are the 
Recordak Corporation, the Spencer Lens Com— 
pany, the Folmer Graflex Company, the In- 
ternational Filmbook Corporation, and Dr. 
Draeger of the U. S. Navy. Leitz, Bausch 
and Lomb, and Spencer Lens have projectors 
that can be used for projection reading, 
though not specifically designed for it. 
Leitz has a combination enlarger and pro- 
jector. The Graflex is working on a com- 
bination cémera and projector. Spencer 
Lens Company and Dr. Draeger are using the 
single-frame aperture of one inch; the 
Recordak an aperture of 3/4"; the Interna- 
ELonaliat wimpook Conporavionimasmuny ln cmnGo 
keep the cost of apparatus down by keeping 
the aperture small, while Dr. Draeger and 
the Spencer Lens Company are working to 
keep the price down by contenting them- 
selves with a low reduction ratio. The li- 
brarians in general, and especially Mr. 
Metcalf of the New York Public Library, and 
the promoters of microcopying in Washington, 
especially Dr. Draeger and Dr. Watson Davis, 
are working with the Bureau of Standards

intelligence with which those working in 
the field have envisaged the difficulty of 
the problem of standardization and have m- 
dertaken to grapple with it. 

Conferences held in Washington, De- 
cember 11 and 12, 1935, by various persons 
interested in the development of microcopy- 
ing resulted in the following tentative 
proposals which were then circulated for 
review, and approved on behalf of the Joint 
Committee on Materials for Research by the 
Chairman and Executive Secretary. 


iT 


There are three media of microcopy- 
ing to be considered: paper, 35mm. film and 
16mm. film. Since the use of paper does 
not involve the need for a projector, itcan 
be considered separately, but the great 
convenience in filing paper microcopies as 
compared with film, and the relative cheap-— 
ness of paper as against film, indicate 
that paper must not be ignored in the mi- 
crocopying problem. Dr. Bendikson of the 
Huntington Library, Dr. Dallas Irvine of 
the National Archives, and the Folmer 
Graflex Corporation in the development of 
their new copying camera are among those 
who have most carefully thought out the 
possibilities of microcopying on paper. 


Ih 


Related to the distinction between 
the 16mm. and the 55mm. film, but not iden- 
tical with the problem of the choice of 
film width, is the problem of reduction 
Pawo Lie hOmeproe jection. 

The International Filmbook Corpor- 
ation and the Recordak Corporation and the 
Recordak newspaper copying enterprises con- 
template the use of 35mm. film with a high 
reduction ratio (16 to 23 diameters, or over). 
Such high reduction ratios are also to be 
used on the 16mm. film. Lower reduction ra- 
tios are developed by users of the Leica 
camera and by the Bibliofilm Service of the 
Department of Agriculture, which uses the 
Draeger camera, especially in connection 
with the microcopying of short items. Any 
reading equipment can easily be equipped 
with reel-holding devices that will take 
either 16mm. or 55mm. film, and it should 
be a rule that designers are not encouraged 
to develop apparatus that will not permit 
the use of either width of film. In con- 
nection with the problem of enlargement 
ratio, a different situation exists. 





151 
LIT 


Projecting equipment, granted that 
it is adapted to both 16mm. and 35mm. filn, 
will vary in the following essential par- 
GaeG aes) 


a. It may be fixed focus or variable focus. 
The Recordak equipment has a fixed en- 
larging ratio of 22 diameters. The pro- 
jective Folmer Graflex equipment will 
have a varying enlargement ratio that 
can be set at will. Each of these meth- 
ods has its advantages and disadvantages. 

b. Some reading equipment throws the image 

on a screen from which it is reflected 

back to the eye; other equipment throws 
the image through a semi-translucent 
screen. The Recordak and Folmer Graflex 
will be of the first type. The translu— 
cent reading machines will be the Inter- 
national Filmbook apparatus, the Draeger 
projection reader, and possibly the ma- 
chine put on sale by the Leitz Company, 
and possibly the machine to be developed 
by the Spencer Lens Company. 

Reading machines differ in the size of 

aperture; that is to say, in’ the amount 

of film they will enlarge for reading at 

one time. The Leica projector takes a 

double freme of 55mm, film, 1" x 1 1/e". 

The aperture of the Spencer Lens Company 

projector now contemplated will be a sin- 

gle frame, 3/4" x1"; that of the Recordak 
is one-quarter of a frame; and that of 
the International Filmbook Corporation 

may be even less. In general, there is a 

relationship between size of aperture 

and enlargement power, because if the 
aperture is only one-quarter of a frame 
it will not permit the reading of lines 
of print that have been microcopied to ex- 
tend across the full width of 35mm. film.

Taking into account the foregoing 
facts and possibilities, it would appear 
that the following developments in projec-— 
tion apparatus can be integrated into a 
common system and so arranged that the 
products of any microcopying enterprise 
could be made available to the projectors 
of any apparatus, with a few exceptions 
that will be noted: 


a. Double frame aperture, low enlarging 
power--Leica (now available but costly). 

b. Single-frame aperture, fixed focus, 1k 
diameter enlarging power, reading by 
transmitted light--—under development by 
Dr. Draeger. 

ec. One-half frame aperture, 22 diameter en- 
larging power, fixed focus, reading by 
reflected light--Recordak apparatus. 

d. Variable aperture, variable enlarging 
power, reading by reflected light--Fol- 
mer Graflex machine. 

e. One-quarter frame aperture, very high 
enlarging power, fixed focus, trans-— 
mitted light--International Filmbook 
Corporation development.

Large-scale copying enterprises, 
such as the proposed microcopying of books 
published prior to 1640, can be made on 
either 35mm. or 16mm. film, either at a 
high reduction ratio (as 16, 20, 23) or a 
low reduction ratio (as 9 to 14 diameters). 
If the master copy is made in a low reduc- 
tion ratio, the possessors of Recordak or 
International Filmbook apparatus would 
merely purchase their film in a reduction 
on l6émm. film. If the original is made at 
a high reduction ratio on 16mm. film, the 
possessors of the Draeger, Leica, and pre- 
sumably Folmer Graflex apparatus would pur- 
chase it in the enlarged form on 35mm. 
film. The newspaper material now being 
copied by the Recordak Corporation in a 
reduction of 16 diameters can be read pre-— 
sumably on any one of four reading ma- 





chines: the Draeger projector will en- 
large it back 14 diameters, at some loss of 
legibility, but it will show the full 
width of the newspaper page; the Recordak 
projector will show only one-quarter of a 
page, but enlarge it above original size; 
the International Filmbook machines will 
presumably show less than one-quarter of 
the area of the newspaper page, but may 
give it even more enlargement than the 
Recordak; Folmer Graflex can presumably be 
adapted to the reading of this type of 
film. Microcopies produced like the NRA 
and AAA series can be read presumably di- 
rectly and without change on the Recordak, 
International Filmbook and Folmer Graflex 
equipment. Wor reading on the Draeger, 
Leica and Spencer Lens projectors, they

lent to 11 2/2 diameters rather than co 
diameters. The short strips of film now 
being distributed by the Bibliofilm Serv- 
ice in reductions of 9 or 10 diameters can 
presumably be read on all projection appa-— 
ratus except that of the International Film- 
book Corporation, and doubtless if special 
instructions are given for the filming of 
such strips by the Bibliofilm Service they 
can be adapted even to the International 
Filmbook projector.

Film Storage and Durability 
To the extent that microphotography 


is used merely as a substitute for interli- 
brary lending, the question of the perma- 
nence of the film is not important. There 
is no doubt that its stability is suffi- 
cient for a span of years in which a schol- 
ar is carrying out a specific research

place of publication, or if libraries are 
to alter their general acquisition policies 
to give a large place to film instead of 
paper, the fundamental question of dura- 
Pitecy OL film must be met. “Dr. A. F. 
Kuhlman, in an article on the preservation 
of newspapers on film, has stated the is- 
sue comprehensively: 


Before we are ready to preserve news-— 
papers in film form, dependable and 
favorable answers must be found to a 
series of unsolved problems. First, 
the Bureau of Standards must settle 
the question of the life expectancy 
of the film record, The Bureau must 
determine: (1) the chemical and 
physical properties of the cellulose 
acetate film and of the emulsion and 
image produced upon it in filming rec- 
ords; (2) specifications for produc- 
ing and processing the film to obtain 
the most usable and durable produc- 
tion; (3) the effect upon the film 
copy, while in use or storage, of va- 
rious environmental conditions-—-tem- 
perature, humidity, light, human con- 
tact, etc.; and (4) specifications 
for storage and use. These points 
determined, it should be possible to 
predict, on the strength of verified 
data, the life expectancy of the film 
if produced, processed, stored and 
used under clearly specified condi- 
tions."9 


The Carnegie Foundation has made a 
grant of $5,000.00 to the Bureau of Stand- 
ards to study film durability, and the re- 
search was under way in the year 1935. 

The research had progressed sufficiently 
by January, 1936 to warrant the conclusion 
that cellulose acetate film, properly 
processed, offers a satisfactory prospect 
Omer el Dal lea ty). 

Moreover, the extraordinary evi- 
dence on durability that comes to light 
with the preservation of microcopied mate- 
rial from the siege of Paris must not be 
ignored. The reduction ratio, it has been 
established, was 32 to 39 diameters from 
newsprint. The film was probably a nitrate 
collodion base, less durable in all proba- 
bility than the acetate safety film. This

discussion of durability has been based on 
the assumption that photographers will use 
a film base more durable, and a reduction 
ratio less exacting, than that which has 
survived for 65 years from the siege of 
Renan. 

Correspondence with film manufac- 
turers and motion picture engineers is in- 
conclusive in establishing rules for the 
storage of safety film. Some advice spe- 
cial measures to insure controlled condi- 
tions of humidity and temperature. All are 
agreed that there is no special fire risk 
in the case of safety film. The Recordak 
Corporation does not recommend any special 
control of atmospheric conditions in the 
storage of film. The Bureau of Standards 
reports a probability that film will dry 
out if stored in atmospheres of deficient 
relative humidity, but dried film can be 
reconditioned and restored. The practical 
plan that was agreed upon as satisfactory 
at the Richmond meeting of a group inter- 
ested in microcopying (May, 1936) is to 
store film in a metal cabinet, keep a cheap 
hair hydrometer in the cabinet, and main- 
tain humidity by putting a sponge in the 
cabinet if it gets too dry. The storage 
of film will not impose upon librarians any 
significant special expenses. 

Assuming the permanence of film and 
the suitability of ordinary storage space 
for its preservation, the microcopying of 
documents for the sake of preserving them 
will be paid for by savings in storage 
space under certain conditions. Figures 
prepared by the Recordak Corporation indi- 
cate that it will pay to microcopy documents 
that are to be retained for fifty years if 
storage space costs are more than $.014 per 
cubic foot per year, and if storage space 
costs $.028 per cubic foot per year it will 
pay to microcopy documents that are to be 
retained for only twenty-five years. The 
costs of Recordak copying are less than the 
costs of the filing cabinets required to 
hold the original material. The microcopy- 
ing fixes all the documents in an unbreak-— 
able series. This is an advantage as a 
protection against loss of individual docu- 
ments through theft or carelessness; it is 
a disadvantage if a file is still active in 
the sense that new material ought to be in- 
terspersed between material already filed.

Since library space costs $.40 to $.50 a 
cubic foot for construction (see Chapter 
II), and gives rise to further costs for 
lighting and heating, it would appear that 
the interest charges and maintenance costs 
of library space would pay for transferring 
material from paper to film. It does not 
follow from this fact that such a transfer 
of material is desirable, but only that it 
is economically feasible. The reduction 
ratio in microcopying that would bring 
about this cost relationship is of course 
a high one--sixteen to twenty-three diameters.© 
The four methods in use for the 
storage of film are: ‘(a) storage in cans; 
(b) storage on reels; (c) storage in a 
cartridge; (d) storage in partitioned box- 
es. The cans, such as those sold by the 
Jam Handy Company of Chicago at $3.00 per 


METHODS OF REPRODUCING RESEARCH MATERIALS _ 





100, are small tin pill boxes. They keep 
each short length of film in place, but 
they offer no protection to the ends, edges 
or surface of the film. The reels provided 
by the Recordak Corporation are suitable 
for long’ strips, just’ as the pill» boxesrane 
for the small strips; they protect sides 
and surface. The International Filmbook 
Corporation has a foolproof cartridge that 
can be inserted in the projection reading 
machine; it protects ends, sides! and sur— 
faces. The Leitz Company sells small met- 
al boxes divided into twenty-five chambers 
each of which holds a five-foot roll of 
Leica film. 

The preservation of the film in- 
volves not only the intrinsic stability of 
base and emulsion, but also requires spe- 
clal care in the processing,” tor tie end

Document size 8 1/2" x 11" (letter size). 


A standard file drawer holds approximately 3,500 letter size sheets and a four-—drawer file cab- 


inet about 14,000 sheets. 


A four-drawer cabinet is 15" wide 30" deep and 51" high. 


It consequently 


occupies 13 3/10 cubic feet of space without considering the aisle space required. 
Using a Recordak working at a 23-1 reduction 2,352 of the above documents can be photographed on 


a 100-foot roll of Recordak film. 


This roll of film costs $2.75 including development. 


Fourteen-thousand 8 1/2" x 11" documents will require slightly under six 100-foot rolls of 


Recordak Film, 


These will occupy 104 cubic inches or 6/100 of a cubic foot of space. 


These will cost $16.50. 


It is entirely practical to photograph 50 letter size documents per minute with the Commercial 


Recordak,. 


Consequently, to photograph 14,000 of these documents will require about 4-2/3 hours. 


At 


$.40 per hour, the labor cost of photographing 14,000 documents will be $1.87. 


HHH HH 


Using the above figures as a basis: 


13.5 cu. ft.-.06 cu. ft. = 13.24 cu. ft., which is the space saved by photographing the documents. 
The film and developing cost plus the labor cost is $16.50 + $1.87 = $18.37, which is the cost of 


obtaining the film copy. 


If the documents are retained for fifty years it will pay to Recordak them if storage space costs 


more than $.0278 per cubic foot per year. 
$18.37 = 50 = $.3674

that no traces of the developing or fixing 
solutions remain on the film; and it may 
call for the protection of the surface 
from abrasion in use. It is a question 
whether the film surface should not be 
given a special hardening treatment to 
protect it from abrasion. The Interna- 
tional Filmbook Corporation claims that 
its projection apparatus is devised to pre- 
vent abrasion; the film is not in contact 
with glass while it is in focus in the 
projector. 

If the cellulose acetate film base 
and emulsion should ever prove to be in- 
sufficiently stable, there is a chance 
thac a microphotographic image on aluminum 
o—id be used. The firm of Siemens and 
Halske has developed a process which, as 
nearly as the writer can gather from avail-— 
able information, puts a photographic image 
on metal without a gelatine emulsion. The 
light, sensitive substance is an inorganic 
colloid, aluminum oxide. This is the "Seo 
Process." Negotiations for its introduc-— 
tion in America are under way. 
Microcopying of Newspapers’ 

The use of microcopying in the 
preservation of newspaper files is of spe- 
cial interest to librarians for several 
reasons. 

a. The library's investment in 
storage space is greater in the case of 
newspapers than in the case of books. 

b. Newspapers printed since 1880 are 
perishable. Mechanical wood pulp paper 
began to be used about that time. A few 
newspapers today publish a special edition 
on permanent paper, and several suggested 
processes are in the field for preserving 
the wood pulp medium. The most tested 
process is that of the New York Public Li- 
brary; a sheet of transparent Japanese 
tissue paper is pasted with rice paste 
over both sides of each sheet of newsprint. 
The cost of this process is $.04 a page. 

c. There is no market supply of 
old newspaper files. Acquisition possibil- 
ities as well as prices of old files are a 
matter of accident. A library cannot plan 
an equipment of newspaper files with any 
assurance that it will be able to complete 
sles TOMuzb ale, 

From another point of view, news-— 
papers would seem to be among the least 





155 












































suited for microcopying, because the price 
of original files of newspapers is low in 
terms of printed area of page. In copying 
the NRA records, for instance, microcopy- 
ing distributed the copies at $.12 per 100 
pages, when the only alternative was hecto- 
graphing or mimeographing at $2.00 per 100 
pages. The Recordak Corporation and the 
New York Times Company have arranged the 
microcopying of nearly 90,000 pages of the 
New York Times for the five years 1914- 
1918 inclusive. The positive copies of 
this file are offered to purchasers at $.66 
per 100 pages. Since the bare subscription 
price of a year of the Times is only $18.00, 
or $.10 per 100 pages, it would seem at 
first glance that microcopying must be more 
expensive than original purchase.

In both cases the cost of binding and stor- 
age must be added to the price of the paper 
copies, and the cost of a projector or pro- 
jectors financed into the cost of the film 
copies. But when considerations of storage, 
perishability, and availibility are taken 
into account, the case for microcopying of 
newspapers is much better than the above 
figures would suggest. 

A comparison of the different pric-— 
es at which newspaper files may be pre- 
served brings into a comparative scale the 
three alternatives now confronting libra- 
ries, namely: 

1. Preservation by purchase and storage of 
original files which may be on perish- 
able paper in most cases, on permanent 
paper in a few cases. 

Preservation by photo-offset in a re—- 
duced scale on permanent paper.

this kind of work, and the project has

a profit if the number of buyers more 


probable that in this instance the actual 
first cost is much in excess of $.10 a foot 
because of the labor of collating the file. 
A special condition that confronts 
those who would microcopy newspaper pages 
is set by the state of present equipment. 
The newspaper Recordak copies loose pages 
only. Each page of the newspaper is 
passed through the machine, first on one 
side, then on the other. In this way 


COST LEVELS AND APPLICATIONS OF MICROCOPYING AND PROJECTION READING 


157 





newspaper pages can be copied in sequence 
invthe "first position" ‘onthe film, ina 
reduction of 16 diameters. If bound news- 
paper files are to be microcopied without 
disturbing the binding, two obstacles would 
have to be met. First, the binding of the 
papers often leaves the inner column ob-— 
scured because of the thickness of the vol- 
ume and the narrowness of the binding mar- 
gin. Second, a great amount of moving of 
the newspaper would be necessary if it were 
to be copied in the "first position" on the 
film. The camera would first take page 
one, then the whole bound newspaper volume 
would have to be moved the full width of a 
page to permit the copying of page two, 
then back again for page three, ete. If 
the bound newspaper volumes were to be cop- 
ied in the "second position," the reduction 
ratio would be greater because the whole 
height of the newspaper--22" in the case of 
the New York Times--would have to go on the 
same width of film that otherwise takes 
18", The New York Times microcopied in the 
first position is reduced only 16 diame- 
ters, in the second position it would have 
to be reduced 20 diameters. 

There are some newspapers with 
larger sheets than the New York Times, and 
some with smaller print. This is especial- 
ly true of old files. The experts of the 
Recordak Corporation testify that even 
these pages can be handled on 35mm. film, 
but some interested persons—-notably Dr. 
Thomas Martin of the Library of Congress—— 
feel that it is safer to count on using 
70mm. film for particularly difficult copy- 
ing operations. The newspaper file may be 
"bad copy" not only because of the large 
size of the page or the small size of the 
type, but also because of blurring or dis- 
coloration. Some of the Russian newspa— 
pers from the years of the Revolution, now 
stored in the Hoover War Library, are al- 
most illegible in their present form be- 
cause of this blurring of ink on a very 
poor quality of paper. However, with the 
example of M. Dagron and his microcopies 
in 32-39 diameters of reduction preserved 
from the year 1870, the technicians can 
probably be trusted to solve the micro- 
copying of bad copy without breaking too 
far from the cost levels indicated by the 
experiment with the New York Times. 

Another important element in the 
question of microcopying has to do with 





the attitude of the readers and research 
workers toward this form. In 1934 the New 
York Public Library did a great service to 
scholarship by utilizing microcopies of 
current months of the New York Times in its 
newspaper reading room. The weight of opin-— 
ion on the part of the readers was favora- 
ble to the use of films in preference to 
the newspapers themselves, largely because 
of the greater convenience in handling. The 
experiment was sufficient to justify the 
conclusion that readers will accept micro- 
copied newspapers in lieu of the original 
files. The new reading equipment being de- 
vised will increase the advantage of the 
process, because it will make it possible 
for a reader to make his own photostatic 
copy of a part of a newspaper page whenever 
he wishes. This will reduce the cost of 
photostat copies of parts of newspapers to 
a materials plus processing cost, for it 
will make the reader his own photographer, 
eliminating expensive labor in the photo- 
stat room. 

The present state of our knowledge 
regarding the advisability of depending on 
microcopying for the collection and pres-— 
ervation of newspapers can be summarized in 
a few statements: 


1. No library should at present embark on a 
large scale plan for the purchase, bind- 
ing and storage of newspaper files with- 
out taking into account the revolution- 
ary implications of microcopying. 

If, as now seems probable, an increasing 
number of newspapers offer their current 
issues to libraries in microcopy form at 
a reasonable price, the chances are all 
in favor of preferring the microcopies 
to a wood pulp paper edition on grounds 
of permanence. 


Microcopying and Library Cataloguing 
Another special use of the micro- 


copying process can be found in the copying 
of library catalogues. It has been stated 
above that the leading library problem of 
the present lies in the field of interlibra~— 
ry coérdination. It was the service of the 
last generation of librarians to bring the 
technique of collecting, accessioning, and 
cataloguing books to such a high point that 
a great library becomes in effect a running 
index, constantly brought up to date, of 
the world's knowledge. But as the demands 


158 





of scholarship increase beyond the powers 
of any library to supply them, the logical 
unit for the next stage in organization be- 
comes the interlibrary system. 

One of the instruments of interli- 
brary cooperation is undoubtedly the union 
catalogue. The largest project of this 
kind is "Project: B" of the Library of Con— 
gress, under the direction of Mr. Ernest 
Kletsch. The Library of Congress is fil- 
ing in a great filing system the author 
cards of the holdings of all American li- 
braries, especially the holdings of rare 
books. Already eight million cards are 
filed. But another use of the union list 
is in the field of library codéperation. If 
the libraries of a given region can cen- 
tralize information about their holdings, 
they can not only save the scholar a great 
deal of time in discovering whether or not 
a given title is accessible, but they can 
make their accession money go further by 
avoiding unnecessary duplication in pur- 
chasing. 

The need for "white collar proj- 
ects" under the Works Projects Administra-— 
tion in 1935 led to the development of a 
technique for using microcopying in the 
preparation of a union list. Projects 
drawn up and submitted to Public Works 
authorities in the autumn of 1935 in Cleve- 
land and in Philadelphia provided for the 
microcopying of all card catalogues of the 
libraries of each of these regions. The 
making of the cards for the union catalogue 
was then to be given to an army of typists, 
who would read the film copies of the cata- 
logues. The reasons for copying indirect- 
ly, through film, rather than directly 
from the card catalogues of the participat— 
ing libraries were, first, that the film 
copy could be made quickly, by one opera-— 
tor, using one drawer of cards at a time, 
and thus without disorganizing the func-— 
tioning of a catalogue room; and second, 
that the typing and checking operations 
could be centralized in one room, with ade- 
quate supervision. Of course the cards 
would be more accurately and quickly cop- 
ied if the film were enlarged by the avail-— 
able automatic enlarging machines to 3" x 
5" card size, but the importance of using 
as large a proportion as possible of Works 
Progress Administration money for wages 
made it necessary to resort to typing. 

However, @ better technique for 





METHODS OF REPRODUCING RESEARCH MATERIALS 


using microcopying in the compilation of 
union lists was worked out by Dr. T. R. 
Schellenberg and Mr. Paul Vanderbilt in 
connection with the Philadelphia union list 
project. They proposed to microcopy a cat-— 
alogue, compare the microcopy film with a 
foundation catalogue of Library of Congress 
cards, designate the holdings indicated on 
the film copy by marking the Library of 
Congress card whenever the title was al- 
ready present in the foundation catalogue, 
and punch the film whenever there was no 
card present in the foundation catalogue. 
The Recordak Corporation machinery would 
then pick out automatically and reproduce 
photographically on 3" x 5" cards the film 
items that were punched for reproduction. 

Under some circumstances it may be 
advisable to reproduce a whole library cat- 
alogue on cards. Three photographic tech-— 
niques are available for this purpose. A 
number of cards can be laid out on a flat 
surface and copied on a large sheet of 
photostat paper with the ordinary photostat 
machine. The sheet can then be cut up in- 
toro" x 5" cards), andmchemcard Siiislc dems Osa 
the Dexigraph or photostat can be used to 
reproduce the cards one by one on 6" x 5m 
ecards of photostat paper. This is the 
process used by the Library of Congress in 
its Project B; it was also used by Yale 
University Library in duplicating its 
great catalogue for internal administrative 
purposes. Then the Recordak Corporation 
can take a 16mm. microcopy of a card cata- 
logue and enlarge it automatically on 3" x 
5" cards. The photostat and Dexigraph 
methods yield a negative (white on black) 
card; the Recordak method a positive (black 
on white) card. The costs run from $20,000 
to $30,000 per million cards. 

There is a possible substitute for 
a union catalogue that may make its way in 
the future in library administration. A 
great card catalogue may be copied on the 
ilémm. film, and the catalogue itself held 
by another library for reference and check- 
ing purposes. A group of such catalogues 
might be called an "assembled catalogue" 
rather than a union catalogue. The cards 
would be consulted in the reading machine, 
like any other microcopied material. The 
cost of making a microcopy of a card cata- 
logue, for this kind of use, would be only 
$500.00 per million cards, including labor 
costs. While it would be less useful than

a union list in one respect--one would have 
to consult each library catalogue separate- 
ly to determine whether or not a given book 
were available--it would in another way of- 
fer an advantage over the ordinary union 
list, for the whole subject entry classifi- 
cations of a library catalogue would be re- 
produced. If, for instance, the film copy 
of the catalogues of the Library of Con- 
gress, the New York Public Library, and the 
Widener Library of Harvard University were 
on the floor of Columbia University Library, 
a scholar could check up quickly the hold- 
ings that each of these libraries had cat— 
alogued under a given subject head. This 
kind of use could not even be made of the 
great Project B union catalogue. The place 
of the "assembled catalogue" in library ad- 
ministration is untested. Another weakness 
in the use of the microcopy of a library 
catalogue as a basis for the organization 
of interlibrary codéperation is the impos- 
sibility of filing new entries between old 
ones. Perhaps the idea will prove most 
serviceable if it is combined with the 
union list idea. Libraries might procure 
microcopies of each other's catalogues, and 
then arrange for the exchange of catalogue 
cards on certain classes of future entries, 
or supplement the "assembled catalogue" (a 
number of copies of separate library cata- 
logues assembled in one room), with a true 
union list of current acquisitions, made 

by filing one card for each new title ac- 
quired by each of the codperating institu- 
tions. 


Photography as the Scholar's Amanuensis 
The analysis of costs and problems 
in the preceding pages has been devoted 
principally to the place of microphotog- 
raphy as a part of a library system. But 
the technique offers a variety of adapta- 
tions to the needs of individual scholars 
who may do their own work. Some scholars 
will find it useful to possess a camera 
that can be used for pictorial and document 
photography alike. For them the Leica or 
Contax, with its numerous accessory fix- 
tures, is the best implement for micro- 
copying. The selection of pages for copy- 
ing and the copying itself are merged as 
one operation, so that labor costs in pho- 
tographing do not appear; the photograph- 
ing is part of the research. The scholars 
who have taken microcopies of documents 








have often found it necessary afterwards 

to enlarge them on photostat paper. If 

the material is such that enlargements will 
be necessary, a step can be saved by making 
the original photograph on a narrow strip 
of photostat paper in the Graflex camera, 
soon to be placed on the market. Or again, 
reflection copying without a camera may fa- 
ecilitate the gathering of records by a 
scholar. 

Just as the scholars of the last 
generation found in general that it was 
desirable to be able to use the typewriter, 
so the scholars of the next generation 
will find it necessary to use photography. 
Just as each scholar works out his own note 
system, combining typescript and longhand 
notes, so the scholar of the future will 
make his combinations of typescript, long- 
hand, photographs on paper, and photographs 
onviiim. sMicrocopying, asa technique wn 
the hands of a man who does his own work of 
photographing and processing, is reduced 
to its bare materials costs. It offers the. 
possibility that a scholar, by purchasing 
microcopies from libraries and by making 
his own microcopies of excerpts from books, 
may build up organized accumulations of 
data that will resemble a private library 
in extensiveness, and a note system in its 
internal organization. Pictorial and tex- 
tual material can be fitted into the same 
file. That which scholars in the past have 
been able to do with the help of an amanu- 
ensis, the scholar of the future may be 
able to accomplish with photographic equip- 
ment. 

It is possible that the development 
of this use of photography-—-whether on pa- 
per or film--will have an effect upon the 
intellectual standards of scholarship, for 
the technique will automatically tend to 
distinguish between that kind of intellec- 
tual labor that is merely the gathering to- 
gether of documents and that which is the 
creative analysis of evidence, 


The Merging of Collecting and Publishing 


An even more sweeping change in 

the pattern of intellectual organization is 
to be anticipated from the full development 
of the possibilities of microphotography. 
The change that can be expected is one that, 
in a way, would restore a condition that 
passed out of existence with the invention 
of printing. For it was the technique and 


160 


METHODS OF REPRODUCING RESEARCH MATERIALS 





accountancy of printing that created the 
sharp distinction between the operations 
of collecting material and publishing. 
the days of the manuscript, copies of a 
book were made to order for a collector; a 
possessor of a book was in a position to 
have it copied when a copy of it was de- 
sired. There was hardly any distinction 
between "published" and "unpublished" ma-— 
terial. If a monastery maintained a 
scriptorium, and if its policy was to ac-— 
cede to requests for copies of its books, 
its whole library was, in a sense, "pub— 
lished" material. 

Precisely this situation returns 
to the degree that microcopying becomes 
generally available. A library with a col- 
lection of theatre programs, or pamphlets 
of the revolutionary war, or historical 
manuscripts may adopt the policy of making 
microcopies of its materials upon request. 
if iteadopts this policy, its whole col— 
lection becomes available to the world as 
if published. If the policy becomes wide- 
spread, so that one institution can expect 
to have its requests. honored at other in- 
stitutions, its collection can be per- 
fected and rounded out according to a log-— 
ical scheme. In that way, the making of a 
collection comes to resemble more nearly 
the preparation of a work of scholarship 
than a mere mercantile operation in the 
book market. Before the eyes of scholar— 
ship there looms a new unit of intellectu— 
al activity--the making of collections 
which will be "complete" within their pre- 
determined limits to a degree that has 
been hitherto impossible. And this new 
unit, the collection, ceases to be func-— 
tionally distinct from a publication. 

The more clearly this merging of 
collecting with publishing is achieved, 
the greater will be the place that scholar- 
ship must give to the bibliographical and 
abstracting services that will guide the 
research worker through the embarrassing 
array of materials that will become access-— 
ible to him. The fact that a given item 
is printed as a book has hitherto served 
to give it recognition in bibliographical 
guides from which unprinted items are ex-— 


In 


cluded. If this mechanical basis of dis- 
tinction loses its significance, the em— 
phasis upon intellectual bases of distinc-— 
tion must be greater than ever. 

Some librarians have raised the 
question whether it would not be wise to 
make up special bibliographies of micro- 
copies that are available. The problem 
they raise is important, but it leads be- 
yond the point they have in mind. If a li- 
brary has installed apparatus for microcopy-— 
ing and is willing to microphotograph its 
holdings on request, does not its entire 
holding become, in effect, available as mi- 
crocopied material? If manuscript material 
is microcopied in Europe and brought to 
America, it becomes a new item, a new re- 
source of American scholarship. But the 
same is true of a body of American manu- 
scripts that may be discovered in an attic 
and deposited in a library that offers mi- 
crocopying service. It is premature at 
this stage to do more than suggest how wide 
the new fields are in the science of libra- 
rianship that are now open for exploration. 
There isy however, one conclusion that can 
be drawn, even in the present state of the 
technique. This conclusion is that we may 
expect that the future will make the small 
libraries more important than they have 
hitherto been: in the intellectual organiza-— 
tion of the country. They will be able, 
not only to draw more freely upon the large 
libraries. in, the service of theiresciclars. 
but also to shoulder their share of the 
burden of maintaining the great archive of 
our civilization. Each unit in the vast 
library system can perform a task that will 
be proportionate to its resources, and yet 
fitted into the general scheme in a unique 
and useful way. The library may come to 
be, not only a depository of printed mate- 
rial, not only a collector of existing rec-— 
ords, but even a maker of new records. It 
may come to be a part of the function of 
the library of the future to reduce to 
writing information that would otherwise 
go unrecorded. There is no community so 
small that it does not offer to a sensitive 
mind aspects of human life that are worthy 
of record, and facts that should be en- 
tered in the dossiers of scholarship. 


CHAPTER XII 


PHOTOGRAPHIC AND PROJECTING APPARATUS 


In the discussion of the cost lev-— 
els and possible applications of micro- 
copying in the preceding chapter, allusion 
was made from time to time to specific 
makes of apparatus, either already on the 
market or under development. These must 
now be compared from the standpoint of 
initial cost and working efficiency. 
microcopying cameras here compared and 
noted are the following: 


The 


Class I. Cameras designed to serve for 
pictorial photography, but 
adapted to use in document copy- 


ing. 


1. Cinescopie (Belgium). 

ec. E.K.A. camera, with Lemare acces— 
sories (used by Library of Congress 
in copying foreign archives). 

5. Leica camera, with Leica accessories 
(used by many American scholars). 

4. Contax camera, with Zeiss acces— 
sories (a later product than Leica, 
but similar in many respects). 

5. Argus camera, an American camera re- 
sembling the Leica (front lens re- 
quired). 

6. Bantam kodak, an Hastman, quantity 
production, low-price camera. 

Class II. Cameras designed primarily for 
document copying. 


1. Ansco Universal copying camera. 

2. Ludwig camera, made to order (used 
at Yale University Library, New York 
Public Library). 

3. Filmograph (not on the market as ap— 
paratus). 

4. Draeger camera (used at U. S. Bureau 
of Agriculture for Bibliofilm 8erv-— 
iC6) = 

5. Commercial Recordak (used in copying 
the NRA and AAA records). 

6. Newspaper Recordak (sole installa- 
tion at Rochester). 


7. Eastman bound—volume copying camera, 
lémm. film (in process of develop- 
ment). 

8. Eastman bound—volume copying camera 
for newspapers, 55mm. film. 

9. Kennedy camera (made to order). 


10. Folmer Graflex photocopying camera 
(in course of development). 
11. Matson camera (built for Edwards 


Brothers, Ann Arbor). 


The Camera and the Use of Film 

These cameras differ greatly in re- 
spect of their use of film. One distinc- 
tion lies between the use of the long and 
short roll. All the cameras of the first 
class take a short roll of film (three to 
ten feet); all the cameras of the second 
class, except the Ansco, take a long roll 
of film (100 feet or more). The Leitz 
Company has made an intermediate camera 
that takes thirty-three feet of film. 
vantage lies with the cameras that will 
take rolls of 100 feet or more, because 
film strips of that length can take advan- 
tage of low processing costs, due to the 
development of machinery for the motion 
picture industry. 

Another distinction lies between 
the fixed and variable frames. All the 
cameras of the first class have a fixed 
frame size for each exposure; some of the 
cameras in the second class have variable 
frame sizes. The variable frame is an ad- 
vantage because it permits the more eco- 
nomical adaptation of film to copy. 

Some of the cameras of the second 
class carry the principle of variability 
to the point where they can use either 
16mm. or 55mm. film. The Draeger camera 
can even be adapted to the use of 70mm. 
film, and the Folmer Graflex machine to 
the use of paper. The more variation that 
is possible in the copying machine, the 
more closely film and copy can be adapted 
to each other. 

Two of the cameras, the E.K.A. and 


Ad- 


161 


162 


METHODS OF REPRODUCING RESEARCH MATERIALS 





the Filmograph, use an unperforated film; 
some of the others use film that is per- 
forated on one side only; others use film 
with perforations on both sides. The un- 
perforated film yields a larger film area 
for the same price as perforated film, but 
misses the economies that can come from 
low processing costs in processing machin- 
ery that requires perforations. The film 
perforated on both sides can be adapted to 
use in a larger number of projectors and 
to processing in a larger number of proc-— 
essing machines, but it is least economical 
in the use of the film area. Some large- 
scale processing machines will not print 
copies from a double-frame negative; they 
will work only with single-frame negatives. 
The machines that use film perforated on 
one side only compromise between the de- 
Sele eine @ ta CLeviOuane ma Sm kine manielntercls 
necessary to perforations, and the need for 
adaptation to moving picture machinery in 
processing. The characteristics of the 
different cameras in this respect are not- 
ed on the chart. 

Another camera quality that affects 
LWCmUS Cr On sia mats a tlae op bl Calensias t Crum mild 
many cases, this is sa matter of ens etii— 
ciency. The problem has been disctissed in 
the chapter above on resolving power. Since 
a lens can often be purchased separately 
from the camera, and the resolving power of 
the lens reaches a maximum with the more 
expensive lenses, the lens might be consid- 
ered separately from the camera, except for 
those cases in which the two are scld with-— 
out the possibility of substitution. The 
Recordak cameras differ from all others in 
that they use a slit rather than a full 
lens. 

One feature of the lens or focusing 
system is not unlike the control of film 
aneacmle: tSareLabvonmto stiches emolG 
fijim area. This is the ability ito vary 
the reduction ratio. Two of the Recordak 
cameras work with a fixed reduction ratio 
and fixed focus. 

A related element of structure in 
the camera is its adaptation to copying 
areas of different size. Some camera equip- 
ment, notably the E.K.A. camera with Le- 
mare Ampligraph equipment, does not easily 
lend itself to taking full newspaper pages. 
This is indeed a matter that may be con- 
trolled by the mounting of the camera rath- 
er than by the camera itself, but the 








mounting is an integral part of a well- 
designed copying equipment. 


The Camera and the Mechanics of Operation 

These cameras differ in the degree 
to which their operation is automatic, and 
hence in the labor costs of photography to 
which they give rise. 

In general the cameras of the first 
class are the least automatic, and the auto- 
matic document copying features appear in 
the cameras of the second class only. 

The features affecting labor costs 
of copying are the following: 

(a) devicgs for holding copy in place; 

(b) devices for focusing; (c) devices for 
making exposures; (d) devices for moving 
film; (e) devices for controlling relation 
of light to exposure. 

The Recordak cameras can be pro- 
vided with automatic light control; the 
Draeger and Folmer Graflex cameras have 
automatic focusing; the Ludwig camera has 
no automatic features. Sometimes the auto-— 
matic features involve hand work, in other 
cases there is a motor attachment. These 
features of automatic operation are desig- 
nated in the chart. 

Another quality is portability, 
often found inversely related to automatic 
efficiency. 

The complete equipment for micro- 
copying is often made up of so many differ- 
ent parts, or subject to such variations 
in assembly, that the chart above does not 
render a full account of the qualities of 
each machine. The machines are, therefore, 
listed here in order, with more complete 
descriptions. 


Cinescopie and Photoscopie 
A Belgium company began operations 


in the 1920's, with a catalogue list of 
"Film 'microphote' de la Photoscopie," as 

a cheap but efficient substitute for glass 
slides used in art study and visual educa- 
tion. It issued a catalogue of geographic, 
religious, scientific, and artistic sub- 
jects, and sought to interest the histori- 
cal associations and library associations 
of Europe in its use as a preserver of pic- 
torial and documentary material. The 


Photoscopie has its offices.at 121 Rue 


Berkmans, Brussels; a similar enterprise, 
the Cinescopie, is located at 29 Rue aux 
Laines, Brussels. Cinescopie, like

Photoscopie, issues a general catalogue of 
film subjects in all fields. The specifi- 
cations of the Cinescopie camera are in- 
teresting. The machine is small: 9 1/2 

x 41/2 x 6cm. The shutter makes automat-— 
ically measured exposures up to one second, 
which is not sufficient for document copy- 
ing. The actual film carrier takes a 
length of three meters of standard 35mm. 
film, which means 120 pictures. The film 
must be loaded in the dark. A "holder con- 
taining more film is contemplated for those 
who wish to take as many as 500 or more 
views on a Single film. The camera can be 
fastened to any photo stand." The pro- 
jector goes with the camera, can be fas-— 
tened to a camera stand, and can project 
downward onto a table. The camera is the 
most portable of all; it is the only one 
that can really be carried in the pocket. 

The Cinescopie suffers by compari- 
son with the Leica or Contax camera because 
of the low resolving power of the lens. But 
the lens is satisfactory for making reduc-— 
tions of ten diameters from ordinary book 
type. The frame of exposure, while fixed, 
is smaller than the exposure frame of the 
Leica and Contax cameras, and therefore 
permits the copying of more pages per foot 
of film. The same observation applies to 
the Eastman Kodak Company's "Bantam," 
$10.50 including supplementary lens, and 
the Argus camera, $12.00 without supplemen- 
tary lens. 

For certain kinds of work, notably 
the copying of whole newspaper pages, the 
Cinescopie, Bantam and Argus would be un- 
satisfactory because of its low efficiency 
optical system. But in the ordinary copy- 
ing of books, this is not a disadvantage; 
the purchaser of the Leica or Contax cam- 
eras should be warned that he is buying 
photographic power that the fixed frame of 
the film will not permit him to use anyway 
in the copying of book pages of average 
typography and size. A principal disadvan- 
tage of the Cinescopie as an aid to the 
American scholar is the absence of a com- 
mercial organization in America to take 
care of sales. The Bantam and Argus have 
sales organization, but no equipment to 
adapt to document copying. 


The E.K.A. Camera and Lemare Ampligraph 
The camera used by the Library of 


Congress in copying foreign documents from 


METHODS OF REPRODUCING RESEARCH MATERIALS 


the archives was of French make, an H.K.A. 
camera manufactured by Krause of Paris, 
with accessories manufactured by Paul Le- 
mare, 73 Rue Fondary, Paris, XVI. 

In 1930 the E.K.A. camera and stand 
were quoted at 3,250 francs, and the manu- 
script box at 511 francs, the lights at 3500 
frances, not including cost of packing and 
shipping. 

The camera uses a sixteen and one- 
half foot length of unperforated 55mm. 
film, taking 100 exposures on a loading. It 
must be loaded in the dark. The dimensions 
of the exposure frame are the largest of 
any used in microcopying: 50mm. x 45mm. 
This use of unperforated film lowers the 
cost per square foot of photosensitive sur- 
fact, but the large exposure frame cancels 
some of this advantage by using more sur- 
face than would be necessary with a maximum 
reduction ratio. The unperforated film lin- 
its processing possibilities also. While 
the E.K.A. camera is theoretically perfect- 
ly adapted to the copying of newspapers, 
the Ampligraph stand that Lemare makes for 
it does not give sufficient height or area 
for this work. 


Leica and Contax Equipment 

The most widely used camera for 
document copying is neither the Belgian 
Cinescopie nor the French E.K.A., but the 
German Leica. It is a multiple purpose 
camera, a piece of precision mechanism, for 
which innumerable attachments and accesso- 
ries are available. Experiments in news— 
paper copying with the Leica were made with 
this camera in 1926 at the Hoover War Li- 
brary at Stanford University; the camera 
used by Dr. Bendikson for microcopying at 
the Huntington Library at San Marino, Cal- 
ifornia, is the Leica; Professor Krisopp 
Lake of Harvard University has used a 
Leica extensively in photographing manu- 
scripts in the Near Hast; Professor James 
A. Barnes at Temple University is another 
pioneer. The equipment has become almost 
a standard implement in research work. 

After the Leica camera had made a 
market, the Zeiss Contax camera appeared 
as a competitor. It resembles the Leica 
in its precision and its long catalogue of 
accessories. These catalogues are so ex-— 
tensive that the scholar may well ask for 
a Baedeker to guide him through them. The 
following paragraphs are written as an

attempt at such a guide, with equipment 
designated by number and code word. The 


differences between the Zeiss and the Leica 


equipment are not significant in respect 
of adaptation to document copying. Both 
cameras used a five-foot roll of 55mm. 
film perforated on both sides. Both have 
loading magazines which can be loaded with 
film in the dark and inserted in the cam— 
era by daylight. Neither will serve as a 
document copying camera until it has been 
supplemented with certain accessories. 


(a) The Lens and Camera 

The earlier models of the Leica, 
notably Models A and B, did not have de- 
tachable lens mounts. They are no longer 
advertised in the catalogues, and are 
available mostly in the second-hand market 
at a price of about $40.00. The normal 
equipment for both cameras is a 50mm. 
f 5.5 lens; the Leica lens goes under the 
trade name of Hlmar, the Contax under the 
trade name Tessar. This standard lens, 
sold separately from the camera, is priced: 


Leitz Elmar 50mm. f 3.5 ......-.. $49.50 (50,320 ELMAR) 


Contax Zeiss Tessar 50mm. £.35.5 


49.50 


The cameras, with these lenses, are priced as follows: 


Leica Model D (50,030 LYKAN) ...... $81.00 (without lens); $130.50 
with lens. Models F and G are higher priced, but the increased price pays 
for qualities that are of no value in document photography.

RESEARCH MATERIALS 





The Leica Model FF with magazine holding 
thirty-three feet of film sells for $195.00 
without lens, or $244.50 with lens. 

In order to equip these cameras for 
document photography, it is necessary ei- 
ther to have a supplementary lens that 
will focus at the necessary short distanc- 
es, or to have an attachment that will re- 
move the regular lens to a greater than 
normal distance from the camera. 

The supplementary lenses are sold 
at the following prices: 


the extension tube is used, however, the 
photographer must have a special device 
for checking the accuracy of his focusing. 
When the front lens is used, he can meas— 
ure the distance from camera to object and 
focus the lens on a calibrated scale; when 
an extension tube is used, he must be able 
to focus directly "on eround class. sinese 
is no technical reason for this, for the 
Leitz Company might prepare scales that 
would permit measured focusing with each 
of the extension tubes. But in the ab-—

Contax (Zeiss) Proxar supplementary lenses, corresponding to 
the above Leitz supplementary lenses, are listed but not priced 


in the catalogue material. 


The Contax catalogue also refers 
to three Delta lenses, which are sold at 
$7.50 the set (#5520); these seem to cor- 
respond to the Leica front lenses in copy- 
ing work. 

With these supplementary lenses, 
the camera can be brought near enough to a 
page to make the page fill the whole frame 
of the film. The reduction ratio involved 
in the use of Front Lens No. 1 in copying 
a normal spread of two book pages with the 
Leica is a little more than eight diamet-— 
ers. In copying ordinary books, this re- 
duction ratio, or something near it, is 
the only one that is possible because of 
the fixed frame size of the exposure area 
on the film. It must be noted that much 
of the high optical quality of the Leica 
and Contax cameras and lenses goes to waste 
in copying ordinary books because of the 
large fixed frame of the film, which does 
not suit reductions of ordinary pages to 
the high ratios that the resolving power 
of lens and film would otherwise make pos- 
sible. 

The alternative to the use of front 
lens equipment is the use of an extension 
tube, which is screwed into the lens mount. 
The extension tube, by increasing the dis- 
tance between lens and film, makes it pos-— 
sible to bring the camera nearer to the 
object that is being copied, and hence to 
cover the full frame of the film with the 
image of a smaller object than the normal 
mechanics of the camera would Permist. welt 





sence of such scales, the use of the ex— 
tension tube is tied with the use of "slid- 
ing focusing copying attachment," Model I 
or Model II. 

The sliding focusing copying at-— 
tachment is a device in which the lens is 
mounted in a holder that carries a ground 
glass at exactly the film distance from the 
lens. The camera, loaded with film, can 
be slipped away from the lens without 
spoiling the film; the focus can then be 
adjusted by watching the ground glass. 

Then the camera can be slipped back into 
place and the picture taken. The differ— 
ence between Model I (57,600 FULDY), which 
sells for $24.75, and Model II (57,610 
FULET), which sélis for -$13is0) 2s" thar 
the more expensive model lets the camera 
slide back and forth in front of the lens 
in grooves, while the Model II makes it 
necessary for the operator to remove the 
camera and lay it down on the table while 
focusing on the ground glass. 

The Contax camera uses another de- 
vice to secure the same result, for the 
Contax, unlike the Leica, has a removable 
back. The camera is unloaded, a piece of 
ground glass fitted in the place of the 
film, the focusing adjusted, and the camera 
reloaded. The ground glass focusing system 
of the Contax is much less convenient than 
that of the Leica because of the necessity 
of unloading the camera for each focusing 
operation. The ground glass focusing 
screen sells for $4.50 (#5520).

With the camera adapted for ground 
glass focusing, the extension tube princi- 
ple can be applied. The Leica extension 
tubes are priced as follows: 


greater convenience in ground glass focus-— 
ing with the Leica attachments. 

The photographer now has his cam—- 
era fixed to a bracket, but the bracket

57,640" (UBECD)*, 2. eem. extenaton tube i sa..... 


Either of these extension tubes 
will be sufficient for all ordinary docu- 
ment copying, but a tube that will permit 
the photographing of even smaller areas is 
the 3cm. tube, which sells for $2.10. 

A study of the Zeiss catalogue 
does not show any attachment corresponding 
exactly to the Leitz extension tubes. Ap- 
parently the Delta lenses take the place 
of extension tube equipment. Therefore, 
the inconvenience of ground glass focusing 
with the Contax can be avoided, since the 
camera with the front lenses can be brought 
into focus at measured distances over meas— 
ured areas by consulting a table. 

To summarize: in order to adapt 
the camera for document copying, the pho- 
tographer needs as a minimum, (a) Leica: 
either front lens ($6.50), or extension 
tube and sliding focusing copying attach- 
ment ($1.20 plus $13.50; total, $14.50); 
(b) Contax: three Delta lenses ($7.50). 

The camera is now adapted to docu-— 
ment copying from the optical standpoint. 
It remains to prepare a stand that will 
hold it in position. Here again a number 
of alternatives present themselves, but 
the minimal equipment is a sliding arm 
that will hold the camera and slide up and 
down on a rod. 

The Leica sliding arm (57,620 
VEARM) sells for $10.50; the corresponding 
Contax item is called a "reproduction brack- 
et" (4995/32) and is priced at $27.00. The 
Contax bracket includes an attachment that 
is very useful, namely, a steel tape at-— 
tached to the bracket to make measurement 
of distance from camera to baseboard a 
simple operation. Note that the greater 
convenience in measured distance focusing 
with the Contax bracket contrasts to the

must be mounted on an upright rod, and the 
upright rod, attached to some kind of a 
base before he can begin work. The Leitz 
Company sells for $103.50 a "universal re- 
production device" of basic equipment, 
which consists of baseboard, upright pil- 
lar, sliding arm, and steel tape measure. 
This equipment includes a special type of 
sliding arm that is especially convenient 
in using the ground glass focusing attach— 
ment. But the essentials are the pillar 
and the baseboard. Bought separately, the 
collapsible upright pillar (57,524 ZSLOO) 
costs $31.50, the baseboard (VAFOO) has no 
separate price listed in the catalogue. 
The combination pillar and baseboard in 
the Contax catalogue is listed at $12.00 
(#1454/28). 

The Leitz Company also offers a 
highly portable apparatus that will serve 
for taking ordinary book pictures, the name 
is "collapsible table reproduction device" 
(57,679 OOZIS), and it costs $35.00. There 
should be a quotation for a non-collapsible 
upright pillar in the 1935 Leica catalogue 
but the writer does not) find its) in 19353 
the 100cm. metal pillar was quoted at $8.00 
(35,463 VERYN). 

But the photographer can take leave 
of the catalogue and its prices when he has 
the sliding arm or bracket, for the base- 
board is nothing but a board, and the pil- 
lar nothing but a column which can be made 
from any ordinary steel tubing, fitted to 
a flange and screwed to a board base. The 
writer made one for $1.50, and many schol- 
ars have built the mountings for their 
Leica cameras in various designs. 

To summarize, the following mini- 
mum investment is required in setting up 
Leica or Contax document copying equipment: 


$130.50 
6.50 (or $14.70)

It remains to set up the lighting 
system. The lighting fixtures included in 
the Leica and Contax catalogues are not 
photographically superior to those that can 
be rigged from materials purchasable at the 
hardware store. Ordinary lighting fixtures 
with electric cords and plugs provide the 
source of illumination, and a system of re- 
flectors must be used. 

The account here made of the light- 
ing problem is applicable to any installa- 
tion. If it is desired to hold down the 
pages that are to be copied by means of a 
glass plate laid on them, the lights must 
be set far enough to the side so that they 
do not reflect from the glass into the lens. 
This side illumination requires more light 
than vertical illumination. Most ordinary 
lighting fixtures concentrate the light in 
spots; to distribute it evenly over the 
material to be copied is a principal objec— 
tive of the photographer. This can be 
done by using reflectors with non-parabolic 
curves, and by diffusing the light through 
semi-transparent tissues such as tracing 
cloth or lens paper. The diffusion screen 
absorbs a large amount of light, and, 
therefore, makes necessary higher power 
lights or longer exposure time than would 
otherwise be called for. 

The purchaser of photographic 
equipment will find opportunity in the Leica 
or Contax catalogue to invest a small for- 
tune, but the minimum essentials are those 
set forth above. 


The Argus 


A camera and projector combination 
that deserves close watching is the Argus, 
manufactured by the International Radio 
Corporation of Ann Arbor Michigan. The 
camera resembles the Leica in many re- 
spects, but sells for $12.50. At the time 
of writing the tests of the camera for 
document copying had not been made, but the 
manufacturers are considering an adaptation 
to document copying. There is also a pro- 
jector, that is priced at $25.00, and this 
may be developed by means of supplementary 


attachments into a reading machine. - 

The Argus camera will never develop 
the automatic features proposed in the 
Draeger or the Folmer Graflex; it probably 
will not attain the optical efficiency of 
the Leica or Contax. But it may well turn 
out to be the American substitute for Leica 
and Contax, for it is going on wthesmarkes 
at the low prices that quantity production 
permits. 


Ansco Universal Still-Film Copying Camera 


The cheapest of the many cameras 
designed specifically for document copying 
is the Ansco Universal Still-Film copying 
camera, which sells for $50.00 including 
camera mount. The lens is mounted on a 
frame facing a vertical copy board which 
can be clamped in position at any distance 
up to three feet from the lens. The copy 
board will hold a sheet 11" x 14", which 
is the largest size that can be photo- 
graphed conveniently with this apparatus. 
The frame of film exposed is just half the 
size of the Leica or Contax area; it is a 
single frame camera, whereas the Leica and 
Contax are double frame cameras. This 
smaller area of film should call for high- 
er optical efficiency in the lens, but in 
fact the lens system is much less efficient. 
Nevertheless, two pages of a book in large 
print, or one page of a book in small print, 
can be copied with this camera. 

The focusing is done in a way that 
suggests the sliding focusing copying at- 
tachment of the Leica camera. The lens is 
fastened to a board, behind which two cham-— 
bers can be moved. One chamber contains 
the film, the other is backed with ground 
glass. The chamber with the ground glass 
is placed behind the lens, and the copy is 
brought into focus. Then the film chamber 
is moved behind the lens and the film ex- 
posed. There is no shutter on the lens. 
The exposure is made by removing a lens 
cap. 

The principal deficiencies of the 
apparatus, apart from the low quality of 
the lens, are the absence of any device to 





PHOTOGRAPHIC AND PROJECTING APPARATUS 


let the photographer know when he has used 
up his roll of film and the vertical posi- 
tion of the copy stand. The film load- 
ings are very short--only three feet. A 
loading is fitted into a small wooden box, 
the box slipped into place in the film 
chamber, and a piece of the film drawn over 
some sprocket wheels. It is difficult 
but not impossible to reload the film mag- 
azine from a long roll of raw film. The 
film loadings, including the wooden maga- 
zine, are sold by the Ansco Company for 
$.50; they contain only $.06 worth of film. 
The film is moved by a downward pressure of 
the hand over the sprocket wheels. But 
there is no signal to let the operator 
know when he has used up his three feet of 
ee al Juin. 

Moreover, the holding of copy is 
very difficult. A book refuses to stand 
up with flat open pages, and even separate 
documents are not easily clamped in place. 
There are some good ideas in the design, 
but the equipment is certainly not suited 
to the needs of anyone who has more than an 
occasional document to copy. 


The Ludwig Camera 
The photographer of Yale University 


Library, Mr. Frederick Ludwig, has designed 
a camera based on the lens system and frame 
size of the Leica, but capable of holding 
@ longer roll of film. His apparatus is a 
wooden camera, with a detachable lens, and 
a unique focusing system. The wide aper- 
ture of the 50mm. f 3.5 lens admits so 
much light that the ordinary process film 
acts like a piece of ground glass in focus— 
ing. There is a tube through which the 
operator can look at the back of the film 
while focusing. The frame used for this 
purpose is spoiled, but the convenience of 
focusing is so great that the loss of mate— 
rial can be ignored. The film is turned 
by hand; the exposure can be made with a 
shutter mount or by removing a lens cap 
from the lens. The focusing is quickly 
done, but it is often not accurate enough 
to take full advantage of the efficiency 
of the lens. This makes little difference 
in copying ordinary book pages, because the 
large frame size of the camera exposure 
calls only for reductions of the range of 
ten diameters. 

Mr. Ludwig has built a number of 
these cameras to order. They are the 


169 





least expensive of the document cameras 
that take the 100 foot roll of film ($50.00 
for the camera without the lens; $15.00 
for the stand and bracket). 

One of these cameras is installed 
in the New York Public Library, another was 
bought by the Carnegie Endowment for Inter- 
national Peace for copying Peace Conference 
documents, another is in use in Spain. for 
copying documents that are studied at New 
Haven by Professor Rose of the Yale facul- 
Lyi 


The Matson Camera 

Edwards Brothers of Ann Arbor ar- 
ranged for the construction of a special 
document copying camera. Their designer, 
Mr. Robert Matson, started with a motion 
picture camera and adapted it to document 
photography. It has the smaller frame of 
exposure, thus permitting higher reduction 
ratios in book copying. It also has some 
automatic features, notably a foot pedal 
that makes the exposure and turns the film. 

Consumers Research, Inc., made an- 
other document copying camera from a mo- 
tion picture camera. Cameras adapted from 
motion picture apparatus start with the 
smaller frame size, the longer roll of filn, 
and the rudiments of an automatic exposure 
system. In this respect, they are more 
promising than the Leica as the basic de- 
sign for a document copying camera. 


The Filmograph and Kennedy Cameras 
Mr. H. C. Lambach of Seattle and 


Mr. Lloyd B. Kennedy of Warren, Ohio en- 
tered upon microcopying as a means of set-— 
ting up the records of title abstract com-— 
panies. They worked independently of each 
other into this field in the 1920!s and 
1930's, and each designed his own micro- 
copying apparatus. In both cases, the 
automatic principle was carried forward to 
a high degree of perfection. 

The Kennedy camera takes a long 
roll of film--1000 feet--but, of course, 
any part of it can be cut off and devel- 
oped when exposed. The shutter and ratch-— 
et to turn the film are operated by a mo- 
tor. The ratchet can be set to move the 
film any chosen distance for each exposure, 
and windows of varying sizes can be fitted 
in front of the film to vary the area of 
exposure. A variable frame necessitates 
the use of a lens large enough to cover 


70 METHODS OF REPRODUCING RESEARCH MATERIALS 





the largest frame, hence a loss in resolv- 
ing power. Hither perforated or unperfor- 
ated film can be used. In building a new 
camera, Mr. Kennedy would equip it to take 
el then emmy orp obmmen ta dins 

The lighting system is wired to a 
rheostat and voltmeter to stabilize the 
light intensity. In focusing, Mr. Kennedy 
makes a test strip to find the best chem- 
ieal (as distinguished from visible or op-— 
tical) focus, and then hooks his lens 
mount in the correct position. The focus- 
ing is more accurate but also more trou- 
blesome than with the Ludwig or Leica cam- 
eras. 

The most interesting part of the 
Kennedy machine is the automatic device by 
which the exposure is made and the film 
turned by pressing a glass plate down on 
the page to be copied. An electric cir- 
cuit, made and broken by contacts on the 
wooden frame that holds the glass, opens 
and closes the shutter, moves the film, 
and then rings a bell to tell the operator 
that the exposure is made and he can turn 
another page. 

Mr. Kennedy counts on a speed of 
5,000 exposures (10,000 pages) per day. He 
will manufacture this machine to order for 
a price somewhere near $300.00 and design 
into it such features as the purchaser may 
desire. The Filmograph equipment is not 
on the market. 


The Draeger Camera 

The Filmograph and Kennedy cameras 
were designed for use in copying title doc-— 
uments for abstract companies; the Draeger 
camera was designed for copying library 
material and research documents. 

The Draeger camera is used in the 
Bibliofilm Service of the Library of the 
Department of Agriculture, and is installed 
in the Library of Congress. It takes 16m. 
and 65mm. film, and can use a special 7Omm. 
magazine. The lens is £:6.5; the frame of 
the film is variable, ranging from 1/2" to 
1 1/2" along the length of the film; the 
film roll is 500 or 1000 feet; the opera-— 
tion is entirely automatic, only the turn- 
ing of the book pages being required of 
the operator. 

There is a prospect thav the can— 
era will be manufactured to order for li- 
braries that intend to use it for develop-— 
ing a microcopying service. Dr. Draeger 








FIGURE LXVII

is interested in developing the design of 
the camera to meet the needs of scholars. 


The Folmer Graflex Camera 

Mr. Edson S. Hineline, engineer 
of the Folmer Graflex Corporation, is work-— 
ing out a camera which will have extraor- 
dinary utility. The camera, now in the 
course of development, is expected to take, 
through interchangeable magazines, any one 
of four types of sensitized material: 
strips of paper 7Omm. wide; 35mm. double- 
perforated film; 16mm. film perforated on 
one side; and 70mm. film with double per- 
foration. The Factograph paper and the 
film strips will be loaded in 100-foot 
lengths. The possibility is anticipated 
of either loading film purchased in bulk 
in a dark room, or of loading specially 
prepared rolls of film in daylight. 

With the 35mm. film, it will be 
possible to make not only the conventional 
double frame full-size exposure, but a sin- 
gle frame exposure one-half the customary 
size. This will permit conforming to the 
principle of maximum utilization of area 
without sacrificing simplicity and uni- 
formity in projection and reading. 

The camera will be provided with a 








FIGURE LXVIIT 


New Folmer Graflex Camera 





PHOTOGRAPHIC AND PROJECTING APPARATUS 


self-supporting stand, consisting of a 
sturdy separable upright column attached 
to the base. When the base is closed, it 
becomes the case for carrying the camera 
and its accessories. The case will be ap- 
proximately 11" x 17" x 6", 

The illumination will be provided 
by photo flood lamps supported from the 
main column in such a manner as to permit 
movement and adjustment to any conceivable 
location. The photo flood lamps will be 
connected with the resistor, which pro- 
vides reduced intensity in the illumina- 
tion except during the brief interval re- 
quired for the exposure. This will not on 
ly prolong the life of the lamp, but will 
reduce possibility of eyestrain on the 
part of the operator. 

The shutter can be set to prede- 
termined exposure time within a broad 
range. The entire operation of the outfit 
after placing the book in proper position 
will be automatically governed by air pres— 
sure emanating from a foot treadle which 
will turn on the lights to full photo flood 
intensity, advance the film, and make the 
exposure of pre-determined duration. This 
will leave both hands free for the manipu- 
lation of the materials to be copied. A 
book cradle, which will be available as an 
accessory, will serve to keep the materi- 
als to be copied in the plane of focus 
through upward pressure against a plate 
glass. 

The value of the machine as a de-— 
vice for copying documents and books re- 
sults from the fact that it is designed 
for this specific purpose, and does not 
sacrifice this purpose to others, such as 
landscapes and art photography. Just as 
a Leica camera will do a great many things 
in pictorial photography, but only a few 
in document photography, so this camera 
has a marvelous elasticity in meeting the 
problems of reproducing research materials, 
but will not do landscape or art work. 

If the scholar wants the cheapest 
possible paper copies, he can get them di- 
rectly by loading the camera with Facto- 
graph paper (not indirectly, as in the 
Leica system, by photographing on film and 
enlarging). If he has a series of short 
items to be copied and filed separately, 
he can take them on paper or film cut in- 
to short lengths. If he has a long series 
to copy, he can take it on long rolls,

like those that are made with the Recordak 
machine. 

The development of this machine 
will be watched with special interest by 
scholars, because this camera is being de- 
signed for prospective quantity production 
and sales at a price that will attract in- 
dividual buyers. The other automatic cam- 
eras are being developed more for the use 
of libraries with microcopying services. 
The price of this camera cannot be an- 
nounced as yet, and the design is not final- 
ly established. It is hoped, however, that 
it will be adaptable to copying for any pro- 
jection equipment, that the price will be 
something near the level of a typewriter, 
and that it may become for the next gener-— 
ation of scholars as indispensable as the 
typewriter. 


The Recordak Bound-Book Copying Camera 
The Eastman Kodak Company is devel-— 


oping a camera for copying bound materials. 
While it is still in an wnfinished stage, 
some details of the new camera are known. 
The camera will be movable but, to quote 
Eastman, "it would hardly be called port- 
able." There are two models, one for 16mm. 
film and another for 35mm. film. This film 
will be taken in 100-foot rolls. The lens 
used will be an Anastigmatic one with f:4.5 
opening. Books up to 12" x 16" and up to 
5" thick can be copied. The machine is de- 
signed to be almost entirely automatic. It 
will be motor driven and a touch of a but- 
ton will automatically bring down the glass 
cover, insuring the material to be copied 
being under the focal plane. The same 
touch will light the lights for illumina-— 
tion, make the exposure, advance the exact 
amount of film required for the next expo- 
sure, and finally raise the glass cover so 
that the book is free for the next page to 
be turned. An automatic device will take 
care of raising the book to compensate for 
the decreasing thickness of the book as 
pages are turned. 

For setting up the machine to copy 
a book, a light is projected through the 
film aperture onto the book, throwing a 
square or oblong form of light onto the 
page to show exactly how much of the page 
is being covered at that particular degree 
of reduction and setting the aperture di- 
aphragm. The camera is then raised or low-— 
ered so that the width of this light

The Recordak machines are fixed

reductions of sixteen diameters, another

tion is satisfactory for good typescript 
copy, but. not for six-point type. 

The machines are leased, not sold. 
The lease price is $35.00 a month for a | 
year's rental, $50.00 for shorter periods. 
The processing price and the price of con- 
venient reels and boxes for film storage 
are included in the price of the film—- |

all use 16mm. film perforated on one side.

Another type of combination is 
found in the union of an enlarging with a 
projecting device. A projector that throws 
a right image through a translucent screen 
will not serve for an enlarger, because 
sensitive paper laid on such a screen will 
develop a mirror image. The projectors 
that throw the image on a screen for re- 
flection to the eye can be converted into 
enlargers by excluding all light from the 
screen except the light that comes through 
the iens. 

The chart of projectors shows the 
qualities of each in these respects, as 
Well as their optical qualities and film

With the reservation that all in- 
formation here given should be checked 
against the developments of the next few 
months, there are a number of points of 
practical comparison between the different 
makes of projectors now being designed or 
manufactured. 

The best established projectors 
are those of the magic lantern type, for 
their manufacture has been launched for 
other purposes than reading. All of them 
have the weakness that they are primarily 
adapted to a longer distance projecting 
than is convenient in reading. The Bausch 
and Lomb Balopticon and the Spencer Lens 
Delineascope take perforated film; the 
Leica projectors take unperforated. The 
Balopticon and Delineascope are more eas— 
ily loaded than the Leica, for they receive 
the film from the side, while the Leica re- 
ceives it from the end. 

Neither the Balopticon nor the De- 
lineascope is equipped with lenses that 
equal the 50mm. £:5.5 Leica camera lens, 
which can be mounted on a Leica projector. 
If a film copy of a newspaper page reduced 


174 


eighteen diameters is projected on a 
screen, only about one-third of one-half of 
the area will be delineated clearly. If 
the center is brought into focus, the edg- 
es will blur; if the text at the edge is 
brought into focus, the center will blur. 
Since the entire page area is illuminated, 
buteonly 2 park of Libbroughtvinteuiocus, 
there is a certain wastage of light. 

The first of the specialized read- 
ing machines were those developed by Filmo-— 
graph and Kennedy. Filmograph worked out 
a method of mounting projectors of the 
magic lantern type several feet above the 
heads of the readers and controlling the 
movement of the film by means of a long 
belt. This device must have meant diffi- 
culty in loading. Kennedy set the projec-— 
tor near the reader's hand and then placed 
a mirror about three feet from the projec— 
tor to reflect the image back to a second 
mirror and thence to a screen. Both the 
devices thus got the necessary distance 
Thomo jeCGd Ol. 

The sii st 
machines used the 


of the Recordak reading 
principLesoi iGhesmd sao 
and ground glass, resembling in this re- 
spect the Kennedy apparatus. Later they 
were shifted to the principle that had 
been used in the Filmograph—-the image was 
projected downward on a reflecting surface 
--and the movement of the film strip in 
front of the lens was controlled by a wheel 
set conveniently near the right hand of 
the reader. 

; The design of the International 
Filmbook apparatus is still undetermined in 
many respects. Its primary quality at the 
moment is a device for foolproof loading 
from a special cartridge, and a provision 
for the movement of the film to avoid abra- 
sion. It will use the translucent screen 
for a reading surface. 

Because Kennedy and Filmograph were 
exposing a large area of film, i.e., had a 
large aperture, they needed a long distance 
to get their projectea image in focus. The 
Recordak, with a film area only about 16mm. 
x 2£0mm., could use a cheaper lens, shorter 
distance, and less light with the same re— 
sult in legibility. The International 
Filmbook equipment seems to be carrying the 
principle of small aperture further than 
it is carried by the Recordak. 

When the newspaper Recordak was 
developed, to read a newspaper page 18" x 





METHODS OF REPRODUCING RESEARCH MATERIALS 


ee" on a double frame of 55mm. film, the 
problem of projection resembled that which 
Kennedy and Filmograph had met by provid- 


ing a long distance between lens and screen. 


The Recordak technicians met this problem 
ingeniously by retaining substantially the 
same optical system that had been worked 
out for the small Recordak, and exposing 
only one-fourth of the newspaper filmslide 
to the light. Since the reader cannot 
cover with his eye at a reading distance 
more than one-fourth of a newsprint page, 
it was a happy idea to project only a part 
of the full page at a time. A lever with- 
in easy range of the left hand moves the

the different parts of the page successive-—

A problem in all projectors is the 
ability to turn the film through ninety de—

microcopies which have lines running across 
the film strip and also those with lines

met by turning the film holder through

Another unsolved problem in projec— 
tor reading machines is that of shifting 
from small aperture-high enlargement to 
large aperture-low enlargement by changing 
lenses and condensers. Of course, a pro- 
jector of the magic lantern type will give 
enlargements in any required degree, but

either 16mm. or 35mm. film; but none of 
them will permit a shift in aperture and 
enlargement ratio. 

Another key problem in the design 
of projectors is the ease of loading and 
place finding. The tendency of design in 
place. finding--which is important for long 
runs-—-is to introduce some kind of calibra- 
tion which permits the reader to turn 
quickly to the desired place in the roll of 
film. The corresponding requirement for 
short runs is ease and rapidity of loading. 
The best apparatus from this standpoint 
would be one which could be loaded, either 
with a reel or a short strip of film, from 
the sitting reading position, without 
stretching the arm upward or outward. If 
loading could be made as easy as turning 
the pages of a book, the use of short-run 
film copies would be greatly facilitated. 

While these observations are in 
some respect inconclusive, they do support 
the conclusion that the problems of design 
in reading machines are rapidly finding so-

Projector—and-Enlargement Equipment 


The combination of projector read- 
ing with enlarging machinery has already 
been noted as a possibility, and the pos-— 
sible development of low cost levels in 





175 


making enlargements on paper from film has 
been mentioned. Dr. Draeger is designing 
an automatic enlarger that should give 
speeds of 5,000 to 10,000 pages a day. The 
essentials of such an enlarger are merely 
the automatic stepping of the film in front 
of the lens, the automatic control of light 
and exposure time, and efficient devices 
for paper holding. 

Dr. Vernon D. Tate, of the National 
Archives, is working out another important 
part of the program of microcopying devel- 
opment. He is interested in the standard- 
izing of instructions covering light intens- 
ities, exposure times, and processing. The 
conditions under which document copying 
takes place are subject. to a far higher de- 
gree of standardization than those under 
which pictorial photography is carried on. 
The object photographed is a black and 
Woittes. theslizhieis usually wartificialy, 
and the range of distances and reduction 
ratios is small as compared with those en- 
countered in general photographic practic— 
es. The emphasis in the technique is def- 
initely placed on fineness of grain and 
high contrast. If the average research 
worker can be trained to be his own pho- 
tographer, and to make enlargements from 
his own microcopy films, the resulting re- 
lease from burdensome mechanical work in 
the collecting and organizing of material 
should have a marked effect on intellectu- 
al standards in research.

CHAPTER XIII 


THE RECORDING OF SOUND 


Cost Levels of Sound Reproduction 
The forward drive of technology of- 


fers the prospect of a number of new pos- 
sibilities in the transmission of texts. 
Television may render long-distance reading 
a possibility. The transmission of fac- 
simile texts by radio is on the verge of 
practical realization. The direct record- 
ing of sound is already in use for research 
purposes, and is definitely superior to 
written reproduction in certain fields 
linguistics and music. 

In general, the technology and cost 
relationships encountered in the reproduc- 
tion of sound follow the pattern of those 
encountered in the reproduction of texts. 

In disc recording of sound, for in- 
stance, the disc area is most economically 
used if it is made to rotate at constant 
linear velocity. The ordinary phonograph 
runs at a constant velocity in revolutions 
per minute. This means that the grooves in 
the short circumference near the inside of 
the disc are moving at a speed of one and 
one-half feet a second, which is adequate 
for the reproduction of sound frequencies 
up to 5,000. But the same number of revolu- 
tions per minute (seventy-eight is the in- 
ternational standard) would then carry the 
outside grooves of a large record at two or 
three times this speed. It takes two or 
three inches of groove at the outer edge of 
the record to reproduce the same amount of 
sound that is reproduced nearer the center 
on one inch. By varying the speed of the 
record in revolutions per minute, the ve- 
locity of the groove can be made constant. 


of 


This economizes record space but increases 
apparatus cost. The relationship is pre- 
cisely the one that is encountered in micro- 
photography, where an increase in cost of 
apparatus yields an economy in cost of filn. 

The relationship of first cost to 
running cost is encountered in sound repro- 
duction as in text reproduction. A set of 
master discs costs about $7.50 for one 
side, $15.00 for two sides of a record. The 
cost of making pressings from these is from 
$.55 to $.75 each, of fifty; or more are 
needed. But an inferior record can be made, 
one at a time, by "dubbing"--that is, play- 
ing the master record and recording it on 
a new disc. The dubbed records cost about 
$1.00 each. The cost structure here is 
like the comparison of photo-offset and 
photostat, and curiously enough, the two 
cost lines cross each other at about the 
same place--twenty-five copies. 

As might be expected, the cost per 
word of sound recording is higher than the 
cost per word of text reproduction, but the 
spread is not so great as might be imagined, 
Fifty 12" discs would record 100,000 words. 
The filing space necessary to hold them 
would be a little more than a cubic foot. 
These records, in an edition of fifty, 
would cost from $2500 to $3000. A very ex- 
pensive printing job, with copious illus- 
trations, might well run up a cost very 
elose to this. 

The figures upon which these con- 
clusions are based were furnished by Pro- 
fessor Miles L. Hanley, who has written the 
following description of the technique of 
sound reproduction. 


TECHNIQUE OF PHONOGRAPHIC RECORDING 


By Miles L. Hanley 


Phonographic recording is rapidly 
becoming an indispensable tool for research. 
Conventional transcriptions cannot ade- 
quately represent the unusual intervals of 
folk music and many of the important char- 


acteristics of speech, such as voice quali- 
ty, intonation, distribution of stress, 
speed and rhythm of utterance. Written 
records, however good, must contain a per- 
sonal and subjective element. Without some 


aotae 


178 


objective check, their use requires an act 
of faith--faith that the field worker has 
heard accurately, that he has been able to 
translate what he heard into symbols, and 
that we know just: what he means by his sym- 
bols. Phonograph records not only provide 
such a check, but they constitute a perfect 
archive of material which may be consulted 
and studied in the future. 

After the invention of the phono- 
graph in 1877, its obvious advantages to 
the linguist, the folklorist, the ballad 
collector and the anthropologist were 
promptly recognized by European scholars. 
The Vienna Phonogramm—-Archiv was founded by 
Siegmund Exner in 1899, and the Musée 
Phonétique by Auzulay in 1900. Since then 
many other collections have been estab- 
lished: a second one in Paris, two in Ber- 
lin, and others in Cologne, Lubeck, Frank- 
furt, Leyden, Oslo, and Zurich. In Ameri- 
ca, although our scientists have made great 
advances in the mechanical technique of re- 
cording, our scholars have been slow to see 
the possible uses of this tool. It is true 
that some folk song and American Indian ma- 
terial has been collected in the past, but 
mostly by the unsatisfactory methods of 
cylinder recording or magnetic recording. 
So far we have nothing in America that could 
be called even the beginning of a central 
Phonogramm-Archiv, but we do have some im- 
portant collections and many more are in 
prospect. A few of these are: Professor 





METHODS OF REPRODUCING RESEARCH MATERIALS 


Greet's American Speech records which have 
been made at Columbia during the past ten 
years, the folk songs collected by John A. 
Lomax, the Gullah negro records made by 
Dr. Lorenzo D. Turner, and the records of 
New England speech made for the Linguistic 
ae of America (United States and Cana- 
da). 


Sound Recording Methods® 

In all kinds of electrical record- 
ing, sound waves (periodic variations in 
pressure) produce mechanical movements-—- 
usually in a sensitive diaphragm. These 
movements are translated into corresponding 
electrical vibrations or variations which 
(usually after amplification by vacuum 
tubes) produce mechanical movements in a 
second diaphragm or a moving armature of 
some type. Electrical variations may be 
translated into light variations (sound on 
film) or into magnetic variations (Tele- 
graphone, Blattnerphone). In the familiar 
phonographic technique, the sound vibra- 
tions are translated into mechanical move- 
ments of a stylus which cuts or imbeds a 
groove in ja disc cylinder MOre sia pmo lmao 
\wakoal joal(ers het film.® The groove may be of 
constant depth, recording lateral swings of 
the stylus (lateral cut, "snake track," 
Berlinerschrift) or of varying depth (hill 
and dale, Edisonschrift). Hill and dale 
recording is used in dictating machines and 
in some very high-quality studio recording,

but lateral cut records are most practical 
for common use at the present time. 

The recording methods referred to 
in the preceding paragraph may be classi- 
fied as (1) Photographic, (2) Magnetic, 
(3) Mechanical. Since the particular kind 
of mechanical recording known as instan- 
taneous recording on disc will be used in 
most research projects, the first and sec- 
ond will be dismissed with a few brief re- 
marks .4 


1. Photographic. In this method, 
electrical variations produce corresponding 
light variations, which in turn produce 
either a varying amount of exposure (vari- 
able density, Western Electric) or varying 
area (variable width, R.C.A.) on a photo- 
graphic film. Equipment for this method 
can be easily portable and can be used un- 
der extreme climatic conditions, but the 
record cannot be played back at once. Ac- 
cording/’to Dr. H. A. Frederick, duplicates, 
even commercial ones, show considerable 
yariations from print to print. "Such du— 
plicate records have thus far failed to 
show as great uniformity as disc record 
pressings. The individual film records are 
Expensive, Geli cave, bulky, sand sditricult 
to handle compared with disks."© In con- 
tradiction to this statement it has been 
pointed out that duplicate prints produced 
by the large film companies are now fairly 
constant and that variations are mainly in 
the range above four thousand cycles. The 
fact remains that it would be difficult for 
the ordinary research worker to get copies 





of any such quality. The excellence of 
film recording is unquestioned, but the ex- 
pense of this method is prohibitive for 
most research projects.© 


&amp;. Magnetic. In this method, elec- 
trical variations produce variations in the 
degree to which a magnetic wire (Tele- 
graphone) or steel tape (Blattnerphone) is 
magnetized across its axis. This method 
requires special equipment and is not much 
more satisfactory than cylinder recording. 
Duplicates cannot be made, though of course 
it is possible, with special equipment, to 
dub the record on disc or film. The great 
disadvantage of the magnetic method is 
that, with the alloys now available, a wire 
or tape soft enough to record sensitively 
loses its magnetism in a short time.7 


3. Mechanical. Mechanical methods 
include cylinder recording, scratching on 
motion picture film, studio recording on 
wax, and the various instantaneous disc 
methods. 

Cylinder recording may safely be 
excluded. It is almost as expensive as 
disc recording, and much less satisfactory. 
The records are fragile, insensitive to 
high frequencies, difficult and expensive 
to duplicate, and quickly worn out by use.8 

Recording by means of grooves 
scratched on motion picture film has not, 
so far as I know, been tried very exten-—

may be used, but duplication is difficult

Specialties Company, Waterbury, Connecticut. 


He is not, of course, responsible for any faults in the 


present account, much of which is inexpertly condensed from his full and explicit discussions. I have 
also used a number of valuable suggestions from Mr. S. K. Wolf, Acoustic Consulting Manager of Electri- 


cal Research Products, Inc.

6. A photographic sound track may be put on disc. 


Such a record is of excellent quality and free from 
surface scratch because there is no surface contact. 


However, the method is not practical for most 


purposes and it is impossible to get more than two minutes of recording on a disc of ordinary size.

nitely. 


They also have tapes which are said to retain their magnetism indefi- 


8. Unfortunately most of the field recording done in the past has employed some kind of cylinder recording 
on the principle of the Edison Phonograph, and a great deal of valuable material is so preserved. It 
is to be hoped that no one hereafter will use such methods, but those who have cylinder records may be 
interested to know that they can now be electrically re-recorded on discs in this country.

and special apparatus is needed both for 
recording and playing. I have heard that 
there are difficulties in keeping the films 
flat and constant in velocity. The record- 
ing medium, celluloid or cellulose acetate, 
is also open to objections which will be 
discussed under disc recording .9 

Since most of us require records 
that can be made in the field and paid for 
from limited funds, studio recording on 
wax is usually out of the question. But if 
the material can be recorded in the studio 
and expense is) no object, records can (be 
made of a perfection that would have seemed 
miraculous five years ago. In studio re- 
cording, the groove is cut inca isoft "wax" 
(really a mixture of metallic soaps). "The 
surface of the wax, after being thus en- 
graved, is rendered electrically conducting. 
This can be done in a number of ways, such 
as dusting with graphite or bronze powder, 
sputtering with gold or silver in a cathode 
chamber, or by the chemical precipitation 
of silver."1°9 ‘The wax is then electroplat- 
ed with copper and a "master" made. From 
this "master" or negative, records may be 
pressed, though in commercial practice, 
where many pressings are to be made, a 
"mother" is electroplated from the "master" 
and from that, one or more "stampers," that 
the master negative may not be worn out. 
The layman who does not understand the del- 
WORY tlatel Glisties Chula, Ost iwee@webias Oia 
studio wax should see the process, or read 
a detailed account (e.g., that in Brown's 
Talking Pictures, cited above). 

What might be called "semi-studio" 
recording has been tried by the Lautabteil- 
ung of the National Library of Prussia and 
by the Royal Irish Academy.11 Portable ap- 
paratus for recording on studio wax exists, 
but it is much more cumbersome than appara- 
tus for instantaneous recording and is open

The remainder of this. discussion 
will be devoted to instantaneous recording 
on disc. There are three kinds of methods: 








METHODS OF REPRODUCING RESEARCH MATERIALS 


(1) those using a pregrooved record; (2) cut- 
ting; (3) imbedding. 

(1) Pregrooved records have been 
widely used in home recording. There are 
two methods: In one the stylus point drops 
into the center of the pregroove, and pro- 
duces a groove within a groove; in the 
other the stylus point fills the pregroove 
and produces undulations in it. The discs 
are expensive, but when a small amount of 
recording is to be done and high quality is 
not required, this method offers great ad- 
vantages, since the ordinary pick-up arm is 
used and no feed for the cutting head is 
required. Very good records may be pro- 
duced with this method by using a special 
turntable and powerful motor, but in this 
case the added cost of discs and special 
equipment is such that one might as well 
have provided a turntable feed in the first 
place. 

(2) Instantaneous recording by cut- 
ting is similar to wax recording in that an 
actual chip is removed from the discs. Com- 
positions of gelatin, celluloid, or cellu- 
lose acetate are generally used. Gelatin 
is sensitive to moisture and deteriorates 
with age. Celluloid is inflammable and 
cellulose acetate less satisfactory in 
quality than celluloid. "Metallophone" 
discs, made in Germany, produce excellent 
results, but the price is very high, es-— 
pecially for the twelve-inch discs. A new 
principle is employed in the Draloton disc, 
also made in Germany. The recording is 
done on a soft "bakelitartiges" material, 
which is afterward hardened by baking. The 
baking process, which does not injure the 
original record, makes it playable with a 
steel needle. But the Draloton disc re- 
quires considerable skill on the part of 
the operator, must be kept fairly cold, and 
deteriorates rapidly with age. For these 
reasons it is not a suitable material for 
field recording. The Presto Recording Com- 
pany of New York markets a disc somewhat 
similar to the "Metallophone," which they

A development of this method known 


as the Spoor-Lindberg system has been tried in Chicago, but I have no firsthand knowledge of it.

claim to be even better. The records, how- 
ever, are just about as expensive. A steel 
needle of a special type is used in repro- 
duction. Under ideal conditions, the spe- 
cial discs referred to give considerable 
better results than aluminum, but since 
most of them are sensitive to heat or at- 
mospheric conditions, or deteriorate rapid 
ly with age, they are, on the whole, less 
suitable for field work than aluminum. The 
Marguerite Company of London uses a simi- 
lar disc which has a smoother surface than 
the Presto, but is otherwise open to the 
same objections and requires a special 
trailing needle. An excellent disc of sim-— 
ilar type has recently been perfected by 
the Sound Specialties Company of Waterbury, 
Connecticut. The disc is coated with a 
kind of cellulose acetate lacquer which 
hardens slowly with time. It may be played 
with any ordinary steel needle. 

An important objection to the cut-— 
ting method is that no provision is made 
for removing the long spiral chip, which 
GONG SmevOmCUIM around thier sity Luss FUL 
recording the chip is withdrawn by a_ suc- 
tion pipe as fast as it is formed. Both the 
styluses and cutting media available at 
present tend to be erratic. The same ob- 
jections apply to records scratched on 
either nitrate or safety film. 

(3) In the imbedding method, the 
stylus is fed across the disc at a uniform 
rate and presses a groove into the disc, 
which has been treated with some lubricant 
to reduce surface noise. Machine oil or 
axle grease is satisfactory, but the clean- 
est and most permanent lubricants are wax- 
es, e€.g., paraffin. The ordinary aluminum 
disc has a hard surface and requires a 
heavy weight on the recording head. It is 
obvious that additional sensitivity could 
be secured by the use of a softer medium 
and a lighter weight cutting head. For 
this purpose, discs softened by annealing 
have often been tried, with varying re- 
sults. If annealed too rapidly, discs tend 
to curve and to record unevenly. Discs 


annealed slowly in oil, however, keep their 


original stiffness and produce better rec-— 
ords. Apparently they will stand as many 
replayings with fiber needles as the harder 
dises.12 A special sapphire play-back 
needle may be used on aluminum discs and 
gives excellent quality without injuring 
the records. Such a play-back needle, how- 
ever, must be made to fit exactly the 
groove in which it is to be used. Conse- 
quently the records made by different ma- 
chines will require different play-back 
needles. 


Field Recording. For field record- 
ing, prime requisites are portability, rug- 
gedness, economy and simplicity of opera- 
tion. Other requirements will vary with 
individual projects. Almost all methods 
known to me have been mentioned, but in my 
opinion, the most suitable for most proj- 
ects is disc recording on annealed alumi- 
num.tS It allows for satisfactory quali- 
ty with simple operation, relatively low 
cost of equipment and materials, ease of 
storage, simple and accurate duplication. 
Single copies may be re-recorded on alumi- 
num at slight cost, but if more and better 
copies are required, a metal master from 
which standard type records may be pressed 
may now be made by direct galvanic proc- 
esses at a cost of under ten dollars for 
the making of a twelve-inch master and sev-— 
eral pressings.14 Portable outfits rang- 
ing in cost from $225.00 to $1,100.00 are 
now on the market. The finest portabie 
equipment I have seen is that provided by 
Harvard University for Professor Milman 
Parry's expedition to Yugo-Slavia. 


Power Supply. When dependable al-

course, the most convenient source of pow-— 
er. Otherwise batteries must be used. 
Some weight may be saved by the use of a 
powerful spring motor for operating the 
turntables, but in any case batteries are 
needed for the amplifiers. When working 
in New England I used a combination set,

fore. 


Those who use many discs can effect considerable savings by having the purchasing agents of 


their universities buy the discs directly from the Aluminum Company of America. 
13. The coated discs referred to above are very much better than aluminum and should be used wherever pos- 


sible. 


But for field recording where the source of supply is remote and discs must be carried for 


periods of several weeks, the aluminum is safer and not so likely to make trouble for the inexpert 


operator.

Microphones. The familiar one-but- 
ton carbon microphone is inadequate for 
good recording, since it performs accurate- 
ly only within a very small frequency 
range; but the best quality two-button car- 
bon microphone, for example, the Western 
Electric 600A, gives a fairly uniform re- 
sponse. A good carbon microphone is satis- 
factory when the speaker stands fairly 
close to it so that small amplification is 
required; otherwise the unavoidable carbon 
hiss will produce a swishing noise in the 
record. The dynamic, crystal, ribbon, and 
condenser types require more amplification 
than the carbon microphone, but have no ex-— 
traneous noise. The condenser is excellent 
in quality, but since it is sensitive to 
moisture and requires particular care, it 
is unsatisfactory for field recording. af 
have had no field experience with the new 
crystal microphone, but have heard very 
good reports of it. The choice between the 
dynamic and ribbon or velocity type depends 
on the nature of recording to be done. The 
ribbon or velocity microphone is highly di- 
rectional, that is, picks up the sound com- 
iiss i eora ClireGwigihyr alia siieeyeie, Gat aly, Cie Caueaeg= 
ly behind it. This feature is often an ad- 
vantage, since background noise is largely 
eliminated. The dynamic and crystal micro- 
phones are not so directional and are suit- 
able for several speakers. Until recently 
the expense of good dynamic microphones has 
been prohibitive, but excellent ones may 
now be obtained at a cost of under $100.00. 
For most purposes the dynamic microphone is 
to be recommended.15 

For aluminum recording it is best 
to use a pre-amplifier, for it is then pos- 
sible to strengthen the frequency response 
at the point where aluminum is poor, namely

above 6500, with a consequent gain in clar- 
aNGiVi. 

The present discussion has been 
largely concerned with recording in the 
field, but there are many other practical 
uses of recording equipment. In laboratory 
experiments dealing with sound, it is pos- 
sible to record simultaneously the sounds 
studied, +® It is very easy to make excel- 
lent records of radio programs either as 
received or as sent out from the studio. 
Many important broadcasts are now so pre- 
served. There are many obvious educational 
applications, among them teaching the pro- 
nunciation of foreign languages, testing 
musical aptitudes, correcting speech de- 
ieets, adding sound ei tects corsa Len tamil nicr 
and, thanks to the process of hearing by 
bone conduction, in teaching the deaf. 

Instantaneous recording with the 
latest type of discs opens up many hitherto 
unrecognized possibilities. Recording done 
with two turntables may be perfectly con- 
tinuous, so that material in any quantity 
is recorded as it is produced. With aNgood 
transcribing instrument, such as is now 
available, one may play such records, local- 
izing exactly the material of interest to 
him, and re-record on a new disc. Re- 
recording in the past has commonly meant | 
serious loss in quality, but with the new 
coated discs, excerpts are almost indis- 
tinguishable from the original. This fact 
is of great advantage in dealing with folk- 
lore, ballad material, or anything produced 
by a naive speaker, who cannot be expected 
to give a rehearsed and timed performance. 
The material may be edited and even re- 
arranged.

CHAPTER XIV 


CONCLUSION 


bance: the first edition of this 
manual was issued in 1931, the whole scene 
has been changed by technological develop- 
ments. Predictions of that time have been 
realized in the actual appearance, not 
alone of new apparatus, but of enterprises 
on a large scale committed to the develop- 
ment of microphotography in scholarly docu- 
mentation. It has seemed almost impossible 
to close the book, because the rush of in- 
novation makes a chapter out of date almost 
as soon as it leaves the typist's hands. 
Even at this writing, information of future 
developments that may overturn some of the 
cost tables is in hand, though it cannot at 
this time be published. 

Nevertheless, from this study there 
emerge certain general principles that seem 
to have constant application. If these 
principles are rightly understood, they can 
easily be applied to the new techniques and 
cost situations as they arise. Foremost 
among these principles is the importance of 
breaking away from the standards that are 
deduced from the technique and costs of or- 
dinary publishing in print, and of viewing 
the whole problem of preservation and dis- 
tripwUtLon Of the records of civilization 
and the materials of scholarship in terms 
of a variety of techniques. The point of 
view must be functional, and the functions 
Omepechniccsinethis fLreld are simple; to 
convey to a certain number of readers a 
certain number of words with a certain de- 
gree ort legibility and convenience, at a 
certain cost. If publishing can be treated 
as a process in which these four variables 
appear, and to which any one of a number of 
technical devices may be applied, the re- 
sults will be nothing less than revolution- 
ary. 

How is a choice to be made among 
techniques? How is the most appropriate 
method of distributing a given text to be 
determined? When printing is assumed as 
the sole method of reproducing the material, 
the formula is very simple. There is given 
a certain number of words. The cost of 


printing that number of words is calculated 
easily. Then the actual or probable number 
of buyers must be calculated. If sales to 
these buyers at the price they are ready to 
pay will not liquidate the cost of printing 
and selling, a subsidy must be found. ler 
order to make the number of buyers as large 
as possible, certain standard promotion ex- 
penditures are made and financed into the 
production cost. The equation works out 
with great regularity in the conclusion 
that any number of words can be published 
provided 2000 buyers will purchase them in 
book form at normal prices ($1.20 per 100 
pages octavo). 

Ordinary commercial publishing will 
take care of the distribution on any ma- 
terial desired by 2000 paying customers. 
But a vast amount of material for scholar- 
ly use and a great many of the products of 
scholarship do not and should not receive 
such distribution. This is the penalty 
scholarship must pay for specialization. 
Therefore the problem of scholarly publish- 
ing and of the distribution of materials 
can be approached more realistically if an- 
other question is placed first on the list, 
another of the four variables first deter- 
mined. Let us ask then, how many copies of 
a given text ought to be distributed? and 
analyze the various techniques from the 
standpoint of size of edition. 


pize, Ofskdition? “The Eificiency =Point 
Every technique of reproduction 


that applies the principle of first cost 
and running cost has some edition size 
which it reaches an efficiency that cor- 
responds to some other edition size in the 
ease of another process. Of course, in all 
such techniques the point in edition size 
is ultimately reached when running costs 
are virtually the only costs that need to 
be considered. In the printing technique, 
for instance, editions of one or two mil- 
lion copies incur so large a running cost 
that the first cost appears only as a neg- 
digible item in the total. © in microcopyine

short items to order, as in the Bibliofilm 
Service, where administrative costs are 
such that it is more economical to make a 
new negative for every order than to save 
negatives and make copies from them, the 
distinction between first cost and running 
cost disappears. The two costs are the 
same. Between these two extremes all the 
techniques of reproduction can be arranged 
in order in accordance with the size of 
edition at which they reach efficiency. 

The efficiency point is specific 
for each technique. The simplest point at 
which to. set it for each technique is at

processes, when divorced from composition 
costs, apply to page or film areas, rather 
than to number of words, and that the num- 
ber of words on a given area of paper or

and convenience. But this variable can be

of 100,000 words begins always with one of 
the two basic procedures: a recopying on 
the typewriter, or a photographing, of the 
text as it stands. The first, being a com- 
position cost, is the same for any unit of 
100,000 words, whether it stands original- 
ly as a printed book or as a stack of type- 
written pages. The second, being an area 
cost, is dependent upon the total area of 
page (the size of the page multiplied by 
the number of pages), and upon the degree 
of enlargement or reduction given to the 
material in photographing it. 

The two techniques—-copying on type- 
writer and photographing the existing pages 
--furnish alternative starting points. But 
there are a number of combinations in which 
the typescript copying is followed by some 
use of a photographic technique. The pho- 
tographic techniques, since they permit re- 
ductions in size, lead to problems of legi- 
bility, and at a certain point begin to de 
mand auxiliary reading devices, such as 
reading glasses, binocular microscopes, or 
projection reading machines. 

The simplest classification of 
these processes is one that divides them 
into two main groups: first, those begin- 
ning with the making of a typescript copy 
of the text; and second, those beginning 
with the making of a photographic copy 
the text. Ihe second, or photographic, 
techniques will exhibit different costs, 
following the number of words per page and 
page area. A minimum for an octavo book is 
perhaps 400 words, a maximum 900 words. The 
table on the following page is calculated 
on the basis of a 400-word page, 6" x 9", 
and hence 250 pages of print as against 334 
pages of typescript. The larger the number 
of words per page in the book, the greater 
will be the advantage of the photographic 
processes over those that begin with a re- 
typing. The processes will yield two class- 
es of result: those legible without opti- 
eal aid, and those requiring the aid of a 
lens or projector reader. 


of 


The Allocation of Costs of Reproducing Ma- 
terials 


From the welter of figures 
timates set forth in the preceding 
ters, and epitomized in the tables above, 
the conclusion follows inescapably that 
printing is no longer to be regarded as the 
sole technique by which the materials and 


and es- 
chap- 





products of research are to be reproduced. 

It follows also that the financing 
of the reproduction and distribution of re- 
search materials may now be accomplished in 
ways that depart from the standards and 
practices of normal commercial publishing. 
The essential elements of commercial pub- 
lishing finance are derived from printing 
technique. There has always been a high 
first cost, a low running cost, and conse- 
quently a profit in the large edition. 
There must, therefore, be promotional ex- 
penses to extend the market and draw in the 
largest possible number of purchasers. Com- 
mercial publishing will be most profitable 
if it can distribute the largest number of 
copies of the smallest number of titles. 
The needs of research pull in the opposite 
direction, toward the distribution of the 
largest numbér of titles in the smallest 
editions. 

Microcopying techniques bring into 
the picture an entirely new pattern of fi- 
nancing. They impose upon the consumer the 
kind of "first cost" that printing imposes 
on the producer. Since the consumer, 
whether a library or an individual, must 
have a reading machine, he must make a sub- 
stantial investment before he can read any 
microcopies. But after his investment is 
made, he pays only a small price for his 
reading matter. The more reading matter he 
procures, the more completely his first 
cost is absorbed. 

Moreover, the microcopying tech- 
niques reach their efficiency point in so 
small a number of copies that promotional 
expenses are cut to a low minimum. it takes 
very little promotion to reach the necessa- 
ry number of purchasers. And after the ef- 
ficiency point is reached, later purchasers 
can be cared for by running off for each 
one the copy that he requires, without in- 
curring the costs of a new edition. The 
problems known to commercial publishing as 
promotion, overprint, and risk are substan- 
tially modified or absent when the micro- 
copying technique is used. 

The use of the techniques that are 
operative in the range below a hundred cop- 
ies permits a similar change in the finan- 
cial perspective. Here also the high pro- 
motion charge can be avoided, because the 
effective market is pretty well known in ad- 
vance. Moreover, some of these techniques, 
notably the hectograph, operate at so low a

CONCLUSION £OL 





cost level that the author himself can ab- 
sorb the cost of production and the risk of 
loss. &lt;A substantial amount of scholarly 
publishing is carried on at present by 
means of subsidies from the author or from 
some institution representing an author in- 
terest. By shifting the technique of re- 
production to one of the cheap, small-edi- 
tion processes, the subsidy requirement can 
be diminished far below that which would be 
needed for publication in print. 

Of course if an author expects to 
receive revenue from his research writing, 
he can not get it unless his writing is of 
the type that is appropriate for commer- 
cial publishing. The technical problem in 
the reproduction of his writing appears at 
another level, where the author is inter- 
ested in the intangible rewards that are 
offered by the world of scholarship. iia) 
these cases the author sometimes makes a 
substantial investment in the reproduction 
of his work, either in the form of a_ sub- 
sidy to the press, or in the purchase of 
copies which he distributes to his col- 
leagues. Author-financed reproduction of 
materials is far less burdensome with small 
edition techniques than with commercial 
publishing techniques. 

The possibility of choosing a tech- 
nique to respond to the demand for a prod- 
uct encourages the development of another 
financing device, which would pro-rate the 
costs of production and distribution among 
purchasers. This device was examined in 
1933 by the Joint Committee, and an experi- 
ment in its use is under way in 19386. 

The essential element of the plan 
is the pro-rating of the cost of production 
among the purchasers, who are brought to- 
gether before the production is launched 
and the sales price per copy fixed. This 
involves as a corollary the appraisal of 
the value of the work prior to its publica- 
paloma. 


Publication Service of Microcopying 
Another plan, utilizing the micro- 


copying technique, is being launched in 
1936 under the auspices of Science Service, 
with the collaboration of the Bibliofilm 
Service. The announcement of this plan, 
which is essentially one of deposit for 
microcopying in lieu of publication, is 
given out by Dr. Watson Davis in the fol- 
lowing circular to the editors of scientif- 
ic publications. 





The development of photograph- 
ic techniques makes it possible for 
Science Service to extend to you an 
invitation to participate in an auxil- 
dary plan of publication which, we be- 
lieve, will be of aid to you in edit- 
ing your journal, proceedings, or 
other media of publication, and to 
scientific publication in general. 

You, in common with other 
scientific editors, are probably un- 
der pressure from authors to publish 
papers of too great length or of too 
specialized content. Or there are 
papers that you would like to print 
in extenso if finances permitted. To 
a small specialized audience, these 
papers in complete detail should be 
made available. 

The following suggested pro- 
cedure will secure effective publica- 
tion and conserve your finances. It 
is hoped that you will join with us 
Loe DUt tlre be niton eiube cits 

Publish as much or as little 
of a paper as you wish in your jour- 
nal. In the case of a very technical 
paper, this may be merely an abstract 
or summary. State at the end of the 
published item: "For detailed paper 
order Document from Science 
Service, 2101 Constitution Ave., 
Washington, D.C., remitting 
cents for microfilm form and 
cents for photocopies readable with- 
out optical aid." The author will 
have his paper typed in an acceptable 
standard form (black fresh ribbon on 
8 1/2" x 11" bond paper, single 
spaced, preferably pica type) and he 
will have photographs mounted sepa- 
rately on same sized sheets. This ma- 
terial will be deposited by you with 
Science Service as a document. Science 
Service will assign a serial document 
number and set a price per copy of the 
document in microfilm or photocopy 
form. Those who wish to have the doc-— 
ument will be able to obtain it by 
ordering it directly from Science 
Service in response to the notice pub- 
lished in your journal. 

The operation of this plan of 
auxiliary publication will be simple 
and uncomplicated. Science Service 
desires that you and other editors use 
it when, how, and if it is helpful. We

ask no financial participation or 
guarantees on your part or the part 
of the author. We only ask that you 
signify your intention of using this 
publication method if and when it 
fits into your editorial plans, and 
that you give the paper to be de- 
posited such editorial supervision 
as you deem necessary. 


The agreement to be entered into by 
the editors of scientific publications 
using the service is drafted as follows:

hereinafter called the Cooperator, 
and Science Service, a non-profit Delaware 
corporation with offices at Washington, 
D.C., hereinafter called Science Service. 

WHEREAS, the Cooperator is desirous 
of obtaining the publication of scientific 
papers and monographs that can not now se- 
cure prompt and complete issuance, and 

WHEREAS, Science Service has de- 
veloped and operates means of publication 
of scientific papers and monographs by 
photographic processes, and 

WHEREAS, it is the intention of the 
parties hereto that such cooperative work 
shall be for their mutual benefit and for 
the benefit of the scientific world in gen- 
eral. 

NOW, THEREFORE, for and in consid- 
eration of the promises hereinafter set 
forth, the parties hereto, do hereby mutu- 
ally agree with each ovher as follows: 

The Cooperator shall: 

1. Obtain from authors acceptably 
prepared typescripts and illustrations of 
such material to which it is desired to 
give publication by means of the Publica- 
tion Service of Science Service, performing 
such editorial services as in the Coopera- 
tor's opinion should be performed. 

2. Deposit with Science Service 
such material as documents, with the under- 
standing that all rights of the author and 
the Cooperator are thereby transferred to 
Science Service. 





3. Publish a summary, abstract or 
short paper of each document so deposited, 
stating that the complete document may be 
obtained upon order from Science Service, 
and specifying the document number, the 
price of the document in microfilm forn, 
and the price of the document in photoprint 
form, the size of the document, the name 
and address of Science Service, in form 
prescribed by Science Service. 

4. Publish in each issue of journal 
or other publication containing such docu- 
ment notice as specified in paragraph three 
above, a statement of approximately one 
hundred words descriptive of the documenta- 
tion activities of Science Service, such 
statement to be supplied the Cooperator by 
Science Service. 

5. Allow the photocopying by Sci- 
ence Service's Bibliofilm Service of jour- 
nals or other material published by the 
Cooperator, whether material is copyrighted 
or not, provided a period of one year has 
elapsed between date of publication and 
date of photocopying. 

Science Service shall: 

1. Receive documents approved by 
the Cooperator. 

2. Assign to such documents serial 
document numbers and set prices for which 
copies of such documents will be furnished 
on order in form of microfilms (photograph- 
ic images approximately 6" x 8" on paper). 

35. Make photographic negatives of 
documents received and file them so that 
microfilms and photoprints can be repro- 
duced from them when orders are received. 

4. Arrange for the keeping of the 
originals of the documents in a permanent 
depository. 

5. Furnish photographic copies of 
documents when and as ordered by individ- 
uals or institutions, at the price agreed

Publication Service by a Deferred Payment 
Palen 


Edwards Brothers of Ann Arbor have 
a standing offer intended to facilitate 
small-edition publishing by a simplifying 
of the distribution of risk between pub- 
lisher and author or subsidizer. The terms 
of this proposal are the following: 


1. They assume 50% of the initial cost. 

2. The author, institution, or foundation 
assumes the other half, either in cash 
or in the form of advance orders on 
the book. 

5. The advance is made for six months from 
date of publication, with a carrying 
charge of 10% based on the cost of the 
edition. 

4. Repayment of the advance is made through 
first sales. Their experience has been 
that the author is seldom called upon 
to repay in cash--sales usually taking 
care of his indebtedness to them. 

5. At the end of six months, any unpaid 
balance is to be paid; if this is not 
feasible, arrangements can be made for 
an extension. 

6. If the book sells better than estimated, 
the author within three months can as- 
sume the entire cost, in which case 
their 10% carrying charge is eliminat- 
ed. 

7. All net sales, after the advance is re- 
paid, are credited to the author 
towards royalty, payable April 
September 15 each year.

In addition to these services, 

Edwards Brothers offers a publishing serv- 

ice described as follows: 

1. They prepare and mail to a list of logi- 

cal readers a circular describing the 

book and reproducing specimen pages from 
it so that the prospective purchaser may 
see the format. 

2. This list may be furnished by the author 
or made up from the proper directories, 
membership lists, faculties, etc.

author, format, date of publication, 

price, and publisher, in the appropriate 
indexes and in Publishers! Weekly, the 
book-trade journal. 

They send out review copies of books to 

the important periodicals in the field 

concerned. Their list of 1400 periodi- 
cals classified by subject enables them 
to select for publicity purposes those 
magazines and journals which concern 
themselves particularly with the materi- 
al treated. 

5. For this service their charge is $25 for 
250 names circularized, and $20 for each 
addi tlonal 250) Iheres is no ;harze tor 
publicity beyond this. 


The production technique used in 
this case is photo-offset from typescript. 
The offer is really a breakdown of publish- 
ing service into separate elements of 
which the author can purchase as many or as 
few as he chooses, and a credit scheme that 
will give the author a chance to get 50% of 
the production price from book purchasers. 

According to a letter just recent- 
ly received, Edwards Brothers report that 
their plan is working quite successfully. 
They have had.a number of books, ranging 
in an edition of from 300 to 900, which are 
selling and which are paying their own way. 
Their experience has been that they can, 
with an edition of 300 or 400 copies, pro- 
duce a book which will sell at approximate- 
ly current book prices of comparable materi- 
al. In addition, they are finding that

viewers no longer comment on the format, 
and if they do, their comments are almost 
always favorable. An indication that there 
is no objection is the fact that the number 
of orders which they receive each day is 


194 


constantly increasing. At the present time 
it averages from thirty to fifty orders per 
day. 

This up-to-date information coming 
directly from the publishers using the plan 
is very encouraging, in that it indicates 
the favorable reception accorded the plan, 
and also the fact that these smaller edi- 
tions will sell and pay for themselves. 


the Services sot the Hd. Wo wilson Company 

The H. W. Wilson Company has had 
extensive experience in a special method of 
pro-rating costs of production among pur- 
chasers. The series of guides to periodi- 
cal literature published by this company 
are priced on the basis of the number of 
analyzed periodicals to which the purchaser 
subscribes. 

Another service of the Wilson Com- 
Dany VT SeatSevienticaia t Mickservice, a wale 
circulates among libraries a classified 
subject list of pamphlets and similar ma- 
terial that may be available either gratis 
or at cost of supply. It will be easy to 
arrange with the Wilson Company to receive 
titles of near-print memoranda issued by 
scholars on scholarly subjects, to circu- 
late the notices of the material in the 
elassified list, and to arrange for distri— 
bution to the libraries upon demand. 





Plans for the Photo-Offset Reproduction of 
Rare Items 

The proficiency with which the 
photo-offset technique will bring rare books 
into print has led to a number of systemat-— 
ic experiments in organizing reproduction 
of them. 

The Facsimile Text Society was or- 
ganized with a list of subscribing members 
and an editorial board to choose titles for 
reproduction. It could not escape the need 
for a large-edition sale, nor could it pro- 
rate actual costs among actual subscribers

not use printing techniques, and tried in 
its promotion to find a plan halfway be- 
tween that of a journal with a subscriber 
list and that of a book publisher, it did 
not escape the accountancy and risks of 
book publishing. 

Mr. John A. Neu of the Library of 
Congress has been a promotor of a large- 
scale plan for rearranging and rationaliz- 
ing book holdings of American libraries. 





METHODS OF REPRODUCING RESEARCH MATERIALS 





One part of his plan called for the multi- 
plying of rare books. The idea that the 
production of the reprints should be 
planned to fit into a comprehensive arrange- 
ment of book resources in the country was 
new. The scheme did not get beyond the 
memorandum stage. 

The H. W. Wilson Company has de- 
veloped an effective book exchange service 
that should prove very sensitive in regis- 
tering reprint demand. The company pub- 
lished a catalogue of essays and general 
literature as a kind of checklist for li- 
braries. Since many of the items on this 
list were out of print, it issued a special 
list of the out-of-print books, and invited 
libraries and secondhand dealers to report 
copies for sale. Six titles were so much 
im denand,, and so Jittleminesuppillys sulci 
the Wilson Company made reprint editions-—- 
in this case from plates rather than by 
photo-offset--but the results were not a 
striking success. It may be that the im- 
mediately effective demand for the reprint 
of a particular rare and out-of-print book 
does not often pass the efficiency point of 
the reprint process, whether by photo-off- 
set or from the plates. The problem, again, 
is one of financing the smallest possible 
edition. 


Concentration of Scholarly Book Production 

In the past few years there have 
been a number of proposals that look to the 
achievement of economies of consolidation 
in scholarly book publishing. It will be 
proposed, for instance, that university 
presses should merge to avoid wasteful du- 
plication, or that a gigantic) union pub— 
lishing institution should be set up to 
compete with existing prices for profitable 
manuscripts, and expend its profits in the 
production of small-edition, loss-sustain- 
ing research books. The evidence accumu- 
lated in the preceding pages amply warrants 
the conclusion that the mere increasing of 
the size of present publishing operations 
will not meet present needs. What is nec- 
essary is a new design, and the use of new 
techniques, to the end that editions will 
finance themselves regardless of the number 
of buyers--whether it be ten or ten thou- 
sand.

CONCLUSION 


195 





Concentration of Processing Services for 
Microcopying 

The development of microcopying on 
paper and film promises to yield low prices 
that will result in widespread use, and the 
widespread use will then reflect back in 
low prices. The critical problem of the 
moment is the maintenance of a low price 
level during the period of development that 
is bringing about the widespread use. 

The institution which is probably 
most necessary for the achievement of this 
objective is a photographic processing cen- 
ter which can offer the following services: 


1. Accept microcopy negatives, either 16mm, 
or 55 mm., both in short and long runs, 
and service them to buyers by making on 
order positive prints in the same size, 
or in enlargement or reduction, and pos- 
sibly on paper. 

2, Pro-rate the costs of making a negative 
among purchasers of the positive on a 
non-profit basis. 

%. Guarantee the highest technical stand- 
ards in the care of the negative and the 
processing of the positive. 


While it is highly desirable to en- 
courage the development of a number of al- 
ternative photographing and reading ma- 
chines, there is no advantage in splitting 
up the work of processing among a number of 
agencies. Efficient machinery is very ex- 
pensive and calls for large footages. The 
scholar who returns from Europe with a few 
thousand feet of microcopies of unpublished 
material, the library that has made a nega- 
tive of its newspaper file, the group of 
libraries which may be organizing an under- 
taking such as the copying of English books 
published before 1640, could all make use 
of a processing center. The accountancy 
standards remain to be worked out; they 
will show marked differences from the ac- 
countancy of publishing. They should be 
established on the assumption of large foot- 
ages. 

Five years ago, when the first edi- 
tion of this report was issued, it seemed 
that the most important need in the field 
of microcopying was mechanical--the effi- 
cient camera and reading machine. At this 
date of writing, the mechanical problems 
are so well on the road to solution that 
they need not cause concern. The next prob- 





lem is one of institutional development and 
of the standardizing of a low price level. 


Allocation of Costs, and the Problem of Ap- 


praisal and Listing 


The problem of allocation of cost 
is intimately related to the problem of ap- 
praising the research value of material 
that is to be multiplied by any technique 
for any number of users. 

The cost may be assessed against 
the author (or some institution interested, 
like the author, in promoting distribution), 
or against the library and the individual 
consumer, or it may be distributed among 
them. It may be met by any one of the 
three interests identified in the first 
chapter of this book as the producer, con- 
sumer, and custodian interest, or by all of 
them in different proportions. But the al- 
location of cost cannot be made except in 
the presence of some kind of appraisal. 

If the author bears the whole cost 
of multiplying the book and distributes AG 
free of charge to libraries, no act of ap- 
praisal of the book is necessary except 
that which the receivers of the book will 
perform in deciding whether to shelve the 
giftvor put it in the wastebasket. 

If the people who are to acquire 
the book are to be asked to contribute 
toward the cost of multiplying it, the 
work of appraising must precede their de- 
cision to assume part of the cost of multi- 
plying. 

At present this appraising is done 
in two ways. The most common is that used 
in the publishing trade. An editor ap- 
praises a manuscript and makes a decision 
to publish; then reviewers step in, and on 
the basis of their reviews purchasers make 
their decisions. 

Sometimes the editors assume so 
much responsibility, as in bringing out a 
series, that the purchasers do not await 
the second appraisal made by reviewers. 
This is the second of the two systems now 
se Sere 

These methods do not place a large 
proportion of the cost on the purchasers of 
books; the author of a Ph.D. dissertation 
bears) most of the cost. 

Both of these methods of appraising 
books and distributing their cost between 
authors and buyers leave a large margin of 
risk. While they have been developed in 


196 


METHODS OF REPRODUCING RESEARCH MATERIALS 





connection with the technique of printing, 
they are not necessarily tied to that tech- 
nique. 

A third arrangement would be possi- 
ble. The appraising of the book could be 
made, not only prior to the multiplying of 
it, but prior even to the distribution of 
its cost between author and purchasers. 
This is the system proposed in a memoran- 
dum of the Joint Committee on a publishing 
service. 

There are two functions in connec-— 
tion with the distribution of the results 
of research which are more intellectual 
than mechanical. The first is the enter- 
ing of information regarding the research 
product in bibliographical guides; the sec-— 
ond is the appraising of the merit of the 
research product. This work is done by 
professional scholars, who may or may not 
be remunerated for it. 

The two functions are related. A 
bibliographical entry implies a degree of 
appraisal; at least the research product 
must be assumed to relate to the topic un- 
der which it is entered. This amount of 
appraising can be left to the author or, 
in the case of Ph.D. theses, to those under 
whom the work was done. 

The more complete appraising that 
is necessary before asking purchasers to 
contribute toward the cost of multiplying 
a book is not so properly left to the 
author or his advisor. 

No matter what techniques of re- 
production are used in multiplying a text, 
these problems of appraisal and assessment 
OuNCOst arise. 

The rational use of these avail- 
able techniques requires, however, that the 
intellectual elements of the distributing 
process, namely, bibliographical entry and 
appraisal, should be made available re- 
gardless of the technique of multiplying. 


Intellectual Implications of Technological 


Change 
A change in the procedure of ap- 


praisal of material and a development of 
bibliographical services to include materi- 
al not commercially published open the way 
to far-reaching changes in the intellec- 
tual standards of scholarship. At the same 
time the prospect that a scholar may be 
able to have material that was otherwise 
inaccessible brought to him, and that he 





may be able to communicate to his colleagues 
writings that he has hitherto been unable 
to communicate to them, open the way to new 
intellectual opportunities. An analysis of 
these new standards and opportunities points 
toward a large-scale redivision of scholar- 
ly labor, which may take a course parallel 
to that which industrial technology intro- 
duced when it opened to the semi-skilled a 
great field previously occupied by the 
highly skilled. 

The semi-skilled in scholarship 
have played a very small role in intellec- 
tual life for the past few generations; the 
amateur has given way to the professional 
in research, and the vast corps of teachers 
in the secondary schools have not been mus- 
tered into the army of productive scholar- 
ship. The concentration of scholarly work 
has taken place not only in respect of per- 
sonnel, but also in respect of location. 
Large library resources have become so nec-— 
essary that most of the work has been drawn 
to great cities and university centers. We 
look out now upon a prospect of change, 
which can be examined in several aspects. 
First among these aspects is the prospec- 
tive disintegration of the distinction be- 
tween collecting and publishing. 

Microcopying and the reproduction 
techniques that are operative in the zone 
of ten copies tend to obliterate this dis- 
tinction, because they mean that any col- 
lection of material--whether in manuscript, 
typescript, or book or pamphlet form--can 
be duplicated or multiplied in whole or in 
part upon demand. If a library has col- 
lected the theatre programs, political 
broadsides, or other documents originating 
in its community, this material has not 
only been preserved from destruction, but 
also prepared for distribution. Moreover, 
a collection of material can be made logi- 
cally complete, regardless of the accident 
of the market, and become in that way an 
organized unit, as if it were a vast and 
well-designed book. Collections of docu- 
ments in the hands of any librarians or in- 
dividuals who are willing to permit their 
copying become part of a great reservoir of 
documentation, open to all comers, irrespec-— 
tive of whether or not any item is a "book 
eT arate! 

This conception--that collecting 
and publishing are functionally merged-- 
should operate to expand and dignify the 


CONCLUSION 


role of the collector, and at the same time 
to clarify the position of the research 
worker. It should become increasingly dif- 
ficult for scholars to publish undigested 
material in the expectation that their work 
will be credited as if it were a true prod- 
uct of research, provided only that the 
texts as published had not previously ap- 
peared in print. Already the effect of the 
new techniques can be felt. A number of 
scholars have gone into European archives 
and brought home collections of documents 
numbering into the thousands in microcopy 
form. If they had gone with pen and ink 
or with typewriter, and laboriously copied 
out a few hundred documents they might have 
been tempted to confuse the result of their 
physical labor with an intellectual prod- 
uct. Since it is now evident that the cam- 
era can not only copy documents by the thou- 
sands, but also permit their duplication to 
order and upon demand, the difference be- 
tween the mere collection of documents and 
their research use stands out with a clar- 
ity it could not previously have possessed. 

This observation does not decry the 
value to culture of that work which tends 
to improve and expand records, to make them 
more accessible, and to notify those who 
should be interested in them of their exist- 
ence. This is an essential service which 
must be rendered. But there should arisea 
new conception of division of labor in 
scholarship, combined with a willingness to 
apportion tasks to the abilities and oppor- 
tunities of those who are available to do 
the work. 

The labor of research is doubly di- 
visible. It can be divided vertically into 
ever narrower fields, and it can be divid- 
ed horizontally into different stages in 
the preparation of material. At the first 
level stands the collection of records-—-the 
function generally left with librarians and 
archivists. Between the collection of texts 
and the distribution of conclusions drawn 
from their study, there stands a long in- 
termediate series of operations, to each of 
which there corresponds some appropriate 
intellectual technique in the treatment of 
the material, and some appropriate mechani- 
eal technique for its reproduction. 

Many of the obstacles to be over- 
come in the development of the full materi- 
al resources of intellectual life are found 


in the attitudes of the scholars themselves. 








197 
Too often there is a veneration of book 
print at the expense of typescript, and 
too frequently a disposition to take for 
granted the finality of the existing dis- 
tribution of labor. But an examination of 
the whole problem of materials for research 
discloses the fact that the problem can not 
be solved in terms of book publishing on 
the one hand, and the labor of professional 
scholars alone on the other. 

The nature of the whole problem of 
materials for research will be clarified 
if it is examined as a series of operations 
that begins with the collecting of original 
material and ends with the dissemination of 
the results of research. 


The First Stage: Collecting and Preserving 
Material 


We are called upon to manipulate a 
civilization based primarily upon the use 
of two substances--metal and paper. Just 
as our economic life has come to be based 
upon the use of metals, so our intellectual 
life has its material foundations in the 
use of paper. 

The world of paper is a world of 
vast dimensions. Primarily, it is not a 
world of books. A single copy of the New 
York Times contains more words than a full- 
length novel. Books constitute only a 
small part of the printed reading matter 
that is laid before our eyes. Most of the 
printed material that is distributed is dis-— 
tributed in newspaper form. But the news- 
papers absorb only a fraction of the actual 
writing that is done. In every business 
office there are typewriters that clatter 
all day putting words and numbers on paper. 
That which is printed is only a fraction of 
that which is written and communicated. For 
every ton of paper that is converted into 
records, there are, perhaps, only a few 
pounds that will ever be added to the perma- 
nent heritage of records to be utilized in 
the study of our civilization, and preserved 
for the future. 

How is the selection to be made of 
records that are to be preserved? How are 
they to be segregated from the records 
destined for destruction? And how is the 
scholar to be guided among those that are 
preserved, to the end that their preserva-— 
tion will prove to be worth while? Our 
libraries operate efficiently in respect of 
certain classes of books and periodicals, 


198 


METHODS OF REPRODUCING RESEARCH MATERIALS 





and even of newspapers and some kinds of 
old manuscripts. But there are vast do- 
mains of records which our libraries can- 
not be expected to govern. The records of 
business and of government and the private 
papers of families must, in the long run, 
be cared for by business and government and 
the family. Only by inculcating in people 
who are not professional scholars a sense 
of the value of records, and by teaching a 
technique applicable to their selective 
destruction and preservation, can this 
great bulk of record material be given a 
rational treatment. A program that would 
attempt to solve the problems of preserv- 
ing and improving materials for research, 
without any resources but those of profes- 
sional scholars and research libraries, 
will leave the great decisions to the play 
of accident. 

Even the ample and intelligent se- 
lection and preservation of records that 
are made in the course of practical life 
would still leave a great gap in the docu- 
mentation. Are there not many kinds of in- 
formation that are of intrinsic interest 
and value to research scholarship, even 
though they do not take the form of records 
unless a deliberate effort is made to re- 
cord ethen? seins ise trues not only, ina. the 
EiCldNO fel ane ust CS bu teal SO na poll ure au 
and business history, and in family history 
as well. The development of radio, which 
does not automatically make a paper record, 
imposes a special duty of recording for 
permanence, if the archive of culture is to 
be complete. 

The field of original record is so 
vast that the conclusion must be self-evi- 
dent; only the recruiting of forces supple- 
mentary to those of professional scholars 
and research libraries will bring ample and 
intelligent action in the preserving of old 
records, in the selection of contemporary 
records for preservation, and in the making 
of new records. 

The human interests that may be 
turned to account to improve our resources 
of record are many. Chief among them are 
the genealogical interest, the interest of 
people engaged in business in the back- 
ground and prospects of their business, the 
collector's interest in a good collection 
of anything from postage stamps to incunab- 
ula, and perhaps a feeling for the pres- 
tige-value of contributions made to the in- 
tellectual world. 





We are not yet intellectually pre- 
pared to develop these human resources. We 
do not yet know exactly how to instruct the 
college student of today, the business man 
of tomorrow, in the techniques and values 
that he ought to know if he is to partici- 
pate in a great common enterprise in the de- 
velopment of record resources. We have not 
yet worked out fully the institutional ar- 
rangements by which collections of records, 
preserved from the past or made in the pres- 
ent, can be appraised, reported, and brought 
to the attention of those who can use then. 
We have not yet analyzed thoroughly the 
categories into which research materials 
fall, nor devised for each category appro- 
priate principles to govern their preserva- 
tion, selection, creation. sors lis tancmmenory 
use. This intellectual problem would exist 
for us, even if we were still dependent 
upon book publishing for all multiplying of 
research materials. But the new techniques, 
since they render collecting almost equiva- 
lent to publishing, make the problem far 
more pressing, and the opportunity far 
greater, than it has been in the past. 


The Second Stage: the Improvement of Dif- 
ferent Types of Material 

The creation, preservation, and 
collection of research material in vast 
quantities will embarrass rather than aid 
scholarship, unless appropriate measures 
are taken to improve it by arranging it 
properly, and controlling it by means of 
lists, inventories, calendars, and other 
ways. 

The classes of record that account 
for the greatest bulk of paper tonnage are 
the following: 


(a) Books, Periodicals, and Printed Pub- 

lic Documents 

Present library techniques are ade- 
quate to care for this material, although 
library resources are in some cases insuf- 
ficient. The public documents of the Amer- 
ican states and of foreign governments are 
very inadequately represented in American 
libraries. But the method of meeting this 
deficiency will probably be found to in- 
volve no other changes than an increase in 
library resources or a distribution of li- 
brary responsibilities, to the end that the 
holdings and acquisitions of one library 
may dovetail with those of another, and the 
technique of microcopying provides 


CONCLUSION 


inter-library service. The union catalogue 
of libraries and the union lists of news- 
papers and public documents are the tools 
required for the improvement of this situ- 
ation. The Wilson Company has made a 
union list of periodicals and of public doc 
uments, and a number of union catalogue 
projects are under way, notably the great 
Project B of the Library of Congress, and 
the union list of the holdings of libraries 
in Philadelphia. 


(b) Newspapers 
The newspaper resources of the cour 


try, taken as a whole, reveal just such 
gaps as are shown in periodical and foreign 
public document holdings. A newspaper 
union list is in the making, but newspapers 
present two additional tasks. The paper 
upon which newspapers have been printed 
since the last quarter of the nineteenth 
century is so highly perishable that the 
whole newspaper record will be lost unless 
large-scale copying or preserving is done. 
Probably the best plan will be to micro- 
copy the files, but, despite the low costs 
of the process, this will be a long and ex- 
pensive process. 

The bulk of newspaper files is so 
great and the miscellaneous character of 
their contents so general, that a distinct 
step forward in the improvement of this 
type of record can be made by indexing, 
calendaring, or digesting the files. The 
Joint Committee has experimented with the 
technique of making a newspaper digest in 
Cleveland, adapting the procedure to the 
training and abilities of a high-school 
graduate relief worker, and planning to 


multiply the resulting digest by means of 
the multigraph process. Though the hecto- 
graphed digest will not be permanent, it 


will last long enough to provide many years 
of study, and a microcopy of the digest will 
be made to give absolute permanence to the 
work. 

The labor cost of indexing or di- 
gesting newspaper materials is so great 
that the work can hardly be accomplished ex- 
cept under one of two conditions--either it 
can be developed by paid labor as a part of 
a relief program, or it can be done in 
small increments by people interested in 
the variety of information that the old 
newspapers reveal, and willing to work to 
put the material into near-print form for 


199 





the sake of the intangible reward of schol- 
arly recognition. The newspaper digest is 
a halfway product, intermediate between the 
raw newspaper material and the finished re- 
sult of research. 

There is one great news source that 
is not at present preserved in any form. 
This is the typescript material that pass- 
es over the wires of the great news serv- 
ices. It is the raw material of news, near- 
er to source than the newspaper itself, and 
more independent of the whim of the city 
editor. Dr. T, R, Schellenberg has taken 
the lead in promoting the preservation of

(ec) Public Archives 

The erection of a National Archives 
building and the creation of a National 
Archives administration mark a new day in 
the treatment of public records in the 
United States. This country has hitherto 
been backward--almost barbarous--in the 
care of its public records. The conjunc- 
tion of the establishment of the National 
Archives and the promotion of white-collar 
relief projects under the Works Progress 
Administration is changing this picture. 
Two large-scale and systematic inventories 
have been organized throughout the country 
under the Works Progress Administration, 
the one to make an identification inventory 
of the records of local public bodies, the 
other to make an inventory of federal rec- 
ords outside of Washington. The Historical 
Records Survey, under the direction of 
Dr. Luther Evans, is also covering some of 
the manuscript records, especially those in 
historical societies, and consolidating in- 
formation regarding then, 

There are three questions relating 
to public archives which deeply concern re- 
SCanCche Scholars meer Sie sm pne molest lLormmots 
record destruction., No archive administra- 
tion can or should preserve everything, 
and yet the selection of material for pres- 
ervation, and the decision on what to de- 
stroy, are not easily made. Second is the 
question of inventory. Even if records are 
preserved, they are of little use to schol-— 
ars until they have been inventoried and 
arranged. And third is the question of ac- 
cess and administration. As local archives 
come to be better known and their research 
uses better understood, it will follow that 


200 


people who are not close to large libraries 
will have an increasing array of opportun- 
ities for research. It may be that tech- 
niques comparable to that which is being 
developed in the making of a newspaper di- 
gest can be worked out, to result ‘in an 
equivalent increase in the accessibility 
and utility of local archival material. 

Though sociologists have utilized 
local data very effectively, the histori- 
ans, economists, and political seientists 
have devoted far more attention to the na- 
tional scene. A leading political scien- 
tist, who is undertaking a study of the 
rise of machine politics in American cit- 
ies, found that the basic preparatory work 
has not been done. The practical need for 
the study of regional economic opportuni- 
ties finds economics far better equipped 
with statistics on national trends than 
with scientific analyses of local situa- 
tions. Newspapers and the local archives 
are a vein of raw ore inviting the labor of 
a host of workers to dig out material and 
refine the product. 


(d) Business Records 

The archives of business are no 
less important than the archives of govern- 
ment, but they are not ordinarily adminis- 
tered with a view to their research value 
in’the future. When an office manager is 
employed to increase the working efficien- 
CYMOLmMamDUSINeESSsOLt Cen One n Ole Hi Smads G 
points of attack is the storage of old rec- 
ords. He tries to get them destroyed to 
save storage space. No business can af- 
ford to retain all records in their origi- 
nal and bulky form, The Recordak Corpora— 
tion offers to business firms an opportun- 
ity to reduce greatly the space required 
for the preservation of old files. Never- 
theless, the introduction of sound scholar- 
ly archival principles into the care of 
business records is a program for the fu- 
ture, rather than a fact of the present. 

The Joint Committee made an experi- 
watspahe, akiel alololbyetstiales fe! adalaeial ‘ley Eljoyoline whale) jeneulial—= 
ciple of sampling to the preservation of 
records. Halle Brothers, a Cleveland de- 
partment store, withdrew from the normal 
course of destruction sample runs of all 
its types af records to cover a period 
prior to the introduction of NRA and a peri- 
od subsequent thereto. Most American busi- 
ness firms have already destroyed the orig-

inal pay rolls, materials cards, work cards, 
etc., that would document the story of this 
experiment in large-scale change of working 
standards. At the suggestion of Professor 
N. S. B. Gras, of Harvard University Gradu- 
ate School of Business Administration, 

Mr. Ralph M. Hower was employed to draw up 
a report on the records and methods of rec- 
ord preservation used by ten different com- 
panies of considerable age and importance. 
The Business Historical Society is inter- 
ested in developing a technique for the 
preservation of the important segments of 
business records. But the road forward is 
not so clear in the case of business rec— 
ords as it is with public archives, news- 
papers, and the books and periodicals 
handled by libraries through the book trade. 


(e) Ephemeral Materials and Non-Trade 
Documentation 


Though the library technique for 
dealing with books, periodicals, and news- 
papers is well established, the same can 
hardly be said of ephemeral items such as 
political posters and broadsides, pamphlets, 
advertising matter, theatre programs, and 
a great variety of near-print matter. 

Dr. Kuhlman of the University of Chicago 
Library is preparing a manual for librari- 
ans on the collection and arrangement of 
this type of material. But here also there 
is a great field for the individual collec- 
tor. During the World War a large number 
of individuals in Germany and many in 
France began their "war collections." There 
were several journals published to serve 
the collectors. With the close of the war 
this interest diminished. But there are 

an almost infinite number of subjects upon 
which the serious and comprehensive activ—- 
ity of an individual collector can bring 
valuable results. Every labor dispute in 

a modern city gives rise to its little 
budget of leaflets and announcements from 
the different labor groups and the manage- 
ment. Every demonstration of relief 
clients is accompanied by its paper shower. 
These documents are a part of the record of 
civilization that will not come to be pre- 
served and organized, except as individuals 
or local libraries take a special interest 
and apply a sound technique. 


(f) Family Papers 
The restricted space in which the 


CONCLUSION 


201 


modern family lives, and the frequent mov- search techniques in the social studies and 


ing from apartment to apartment that be- 
comes normal in urban civilization, make 
the hoarding of family papers, whether 
ancient or current, a burdensome load. Sur- 
veys of historical documentation in New 
York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and other 
places have disclosed a wealth of valuable 
records in the form of old letters. The 
complete rationalization of the care of 
family papers would call for at least three 
things: first, the reporting of holdings 
of old papers; second, the proper selec- 
tion, preservation, and care of current pa- 
pers; and third, a responsibility in each 
family to record the history of itself, or 
the biography of its members. 

The interest that many individuals 
develop in genealogy can perhaps be chan- 
neled in such a way that it will yield re- 
sults valuable to the world of scholarship. 
Dr. Jean Stephenson, Chairman of the Genea- 
logical Records Committee of the Daughters 
of the American Revolution, is sounding out 
this possibility and is prepared to de- 
velop it in a forthcoming manual on genea- 
logical research. 

Thus the collection, selection, 
listing and care of records, whether public 
archives, business documents, or family pa- 
pers, is a vast task in which a large ele- 
ment of the population can be trained to 
share. The value of everything they do will 
be increased by the greater mobility that 
all records possess by virtue of the new 
techniques of reproduction. 


Simplified Research Techniques 
Above the level of the simple col- 


lecting and organizing of material, there 
lies a zone of possible activity intermedi- 
ate between the higher research, to which 
the highly trained professional scholars 
may be expected to devote their time, and 
the more humble task of accumulating and 
arranging. The proposal has been present- 
ed to the American Council of Learned So- 
cieties and the Social Science Research 
Council that steps should be taken to de- 
vise simplified research techniques, by 
which the semi-skilled in scholarship could 
make their contributions, and those who 
have only a limited amount of time or lim- 
ited documentary equipment for research, 
may be brought to contribute their share. 
The development of simplified re- 








some of the humanities would result in an 
increase in the actual working personnel of 
American scholarship, especially by drawing 
in the following types of workers: 


a) University, college, and high-school 
teachers who, because of limitations of 
time, materials or training, are not 
able to keep the pace set by the most 
advanced research workers. 

b) College graduates, not engaged in aca- 
demic work, but having at their disposal 
time and interests--in some cases money 
--that can be devoted to scholarly pur- 
poses. 

c) Business men whose interest in their own 
business or the economic setting of 
their own community is guided toward ac- 
curate and sound methods of investiga- 
aoe 


The broadening of the base of the 
pyramid of scholarly activity would con- 
tribute to the whole field of education. 
The schism in the intellectual world that 
resulted from the preoccupation of those 
interested in pedagogy with methods of in-— 
struction, at the expense of content of 
learning, and of research workers in con- 
tent, at the expense of methods of instruc- 
tion, has not strengthened, but rather has 
weakened intellectual life. It has re- 
sulted in a situation in which the teaching 
career, especially in the secondary school, 
is made less attractive in terms of in- 
tellectual dignity than it would need to 
be. A good teacher can always teach more 
effectively if she is able to illustrate 
generalizations in history, social studies, 
or other fields from local and familiar in- 
stances. But such illustrations presuppose 
a sound investigation of the local data in 
relation to the general findings of a dis- 
cipline; and if such an investigation is 
made, its result is more than an item of 
teaching materials ei teis, in fact. an ad= 
ditional datum in the inductive structure 
of the discipline itself. 

The present generation should not 
be surprised at the conclusion that a tech- 
nologucalMRevolunvonsnasmne taabiemsecasmoits 
a cultural revolution. Such may indeed be 
true in this instance. The cultural reviv— 
al of the small town as against the monop- 
oly of the metropolis, and the democratization

and"deprofessionalization" of scholarship 
are on the horizon which seems to lie 
ahead. And these things, themselves, ac- 
cord with other elements of our social and 
economic prospects--notably the possible 
decline in the centralization of popula- 
tion in cities and the development of a 


new leisure in the hands of a well-educat- 
ed people. The same technical innova- 
tions that promise to give aid to the re- 
search worker in his cubicle may also 
lead the whole population toward partici- 
pation in a new cultural design.
